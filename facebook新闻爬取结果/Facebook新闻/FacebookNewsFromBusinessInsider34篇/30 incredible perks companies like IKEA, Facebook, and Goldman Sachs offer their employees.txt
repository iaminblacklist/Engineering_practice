And perks help â a lot.According to career site Glassdoor, more than half (57%) of all workers say perks and benefits are among the top things they consider when deciding whether to accept a job, and almost 80% of employees say they would prefer new benefits over a pay raise.Thats why some employers are raising the bar and going beyond standard vacation days and health insurance benefits to attract new talent.Companies like Airbnb and Salesforce are offering unique and surprising perks like travel stipends and paid time off to volunteer, while companies like IKEA and Pinterest are stepping up their game for helping new parents."Benefits and perks matter because theyre an added piece of the total compensation puzzle," says Scott Dobroski, Glassdoors career trends analyst.
