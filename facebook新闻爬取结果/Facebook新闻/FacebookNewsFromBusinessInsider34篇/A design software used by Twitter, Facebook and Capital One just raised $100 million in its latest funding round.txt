InVision CEO Clark ValbergInVisionTurns out product design is good business â at least if youre  InVision.ÂInVision, a design collaboration software company  launched in 2011, announced $100 million in Series E funding on  Wednesday, in a round led by Battery Ventures."The world has kind of woken up  to the idea that digital products are driving the customer  experience," Clark Valberg, CEO of InVision, told Business  Insider. "The best  companies in the world have shown that you can disrupt an entire  market with an app, and make that app so well designed and  beloved by the customer that you never look back."While Valberg was talking about  the customers that design apps using InVisions software,  the same could be said for the company itself.InVisions success is in  part due to a gap in the offerings of Adobe, which has long  controlled the design software space with its Creative Cloud  of products like InDesign and Photoshop. Though many designers  learn their trade on Adobes complex and expansive software,  Valberg says collaborating on single project files has always  been a difficult task in the Creative Cloud  universe.Â"The world of digital product  design â how the worlds best companies make their products â has  eluded them for years," Valberg said of his  competitor.ÂJust  as InVisions product facilitates multiple people  remotely work on a single design project, the company itself  is "fully distributed" with employees across 24 different  countries.ÂPart of the staff spread also comes from its many acquisitions â  seven of which were made in the last two years. The team grew in  size from 50 people in 2015 to 450. And that number is only going  to grow now that InVision has more funding.And with 80% of the Fortune 100 as customers â including  companies like IBM, Disney,  Nike, Airbnb, Facebook, Twitter and Capital One â the growing  staff will have their work cut out for them."Everything you consume is being  redesigned to make it easier, more fun, faster, more emotionally  satisfying for you and for everybody on the planet," Valberg  said. "This is what we call the customer experience  revolution."
