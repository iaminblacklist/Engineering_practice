QuipÂSalesforce and Facebook are teaming up to take on both Microsoft  and Google in business software.The cloud-software provider and the social networking giant are  expected to announce Tuesday that they are enhancing the  integration of Salesforces  Quip productivity app with   Facebooks Workplace, which is a version of the companys  social network that was designed specifically for businesses. The  collaboration is designed to make it easier to share Quip  documents in Workplace and see there a list of all documents  shared.ÂThe partnership,   first announced back in April and deepend today, could  help the two companies better compete with Microsofts Office and  Googles G Suite.But the deal could have other benefits. The partnership will  give both Salesforce and Facebook a way in with each others  customers.Quip already integrates tightly with Salesforces core customer  management and marketing software. By making it easier to use  Quip in Workplace, the deal could make Facebooks  service more enticing to Salesforce customers.Meanwhile, Workplace customers who give Quip a whirl will get an  easy on-ramp to the wider world of Salesforce.That kind of cross-selling will likely be important to the  future viability of both Quip and Workplace.Salesforce bought Quip last year for $750 million. At  the time, Bret Taylor, who founded Quip and formerly served as  Facebooks chief technology officer, said the  deal would be a huge boon for selling to businesses.While lucrative, the business market can be tricky for a new  player to crack without the support of a major player like  Salesforce, because businesses tend to stick with established  partners. That dynamic is a big part of why Microsoft Office  has remained entrenched as the workplace standard â its the  safe, known choice for businesses to buy.ÂWorkplace has seen some early momentum, with   30,000 organizations signed on and counting. But it has a  long way to go to be a serious rival to Microsoft Office or  Googles G Suite. Partnering up with Salesforce could give  Workplace a little extra clout with enterprises.ÂGet the latest Microsoft stock price here.
