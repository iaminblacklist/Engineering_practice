Thomson  ReutersFacebook has decided how to finally make money from WhatsApp:  charge businesses that want to conduct customer support in the  app.WhatsApps program for businesses will charge large companies  that want to be verified and have access to a suite of automated  tools for helping and responding to customers, the Facebook-owned  app announced on Tuesday. A free standalone mobile app for small  businesses will also offer similar features.The tools and standalone app for businesses were both recently  uncovered   in WhatsApps own documentation and app code. WhatsApp is  testing its business program privately with a handful of  businesses around the world and hasnt said when it will make the  program more widely available. It also hasnt said how much it  plans to charge businesses for access to its full suite of tools.âWhatsApp has simplified communication for people around the  world. Now, we want to apply this same approach to bringing  businesses onto WhatsApp in ways that create value for people,"  WhatsApp chief operating officer Matt Idema said in a statement  shared with Business Insider. "Were looking forward to making it  possible for people to connect with businesses in a fast and  personal way, and giving businesses the tools to make that easier  to do.âWhatsApp envisions letting businesses like airlines and banks  field customer questions and provide updates for things like  flight times, the company   said in a blog post on Tuesday. A payments service is also in  the works for WhatsApp, which could open the door for Facebook to  charge businesses for conducting transactions.Facebook spent $22 billion on acquiring WhatsApp in 2014.  The app used to charge users a $1 per year subscription but  dropped the fee in early 2016. WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum has    long been a staunch opponent of traditional advertising and  has promised that the app will never show ads.By choosing to charge businesses out of the gate, WhatsApp  is taking a different approach to making money than Messenger,  Facebooks other standalone messaging app. Messenger let  businesses conduct customer support for free but never managed to  monetize the approach. The app has recently  started showing ads.
