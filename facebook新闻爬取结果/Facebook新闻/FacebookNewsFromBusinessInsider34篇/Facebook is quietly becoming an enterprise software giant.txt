Workplace is like a  private version of Facebook for a businesss  employees.FacebookFacebook has quietly become a sizeable force in the competitive  enterprise software market currently dominated by  incumbents like Microsoft and newer upstarts like Slack.The social networks communication tool for businesses,  Workplace is now used by more than 30,000 organizations after one  year, up from 14,000 in April. Facebook also announced on  Thursday a desktop chat app for Workplace and plans to  add support for group video calling "in the coming weeks."In an interview with Business Insider, Workplace product manager  Simon Cross contributed the tools early success to the big  companies that started using Workplace early. In its first  year, Workplace managed to sign on a slew of household names like  Starbucks, Delta, Lyft, Spotify, Heineken. The team  also recently  signed a deal with Walmart, the largest private employer  in the world.âThose names lend a huge amount of credibility to the product,â  said Cross. âA lot of other companies begin to sit up and take  notice."Workplace is now used in 79 languages and by people on every  continent. And Facebook is in the process of  aggressively expanding the teams ranks with open job  listings for growth managers and salespeople.The social network has yet to disclose how many businesses  pay for the service, which charges per user per month. Facebook  just recently started billing companies that elect to pay  for features needed for managing larger workforces, like  integration with compliance partners.Its also unclear how deeply Workplace is being used within the  30,000 organizations that have signed on so far.  That number includes companies that may not have  deployed Workplace to all their employees, according to a  Facebook spokesperson.Privately-held Slack, by comparison, claims more than two million  paid users and 50,000 paid teams, although large  companies can pay for multiple teams to keep divisions  within their organizations separate from each other.Workplaces apps have been  given a fresh coat of paint.WorkplaceAccording to Cross, Workplaces biggest advantage against  chat-based competitors like Slack is that Facebook is building a  full-fledged communication platform rather than a primarily  chat-based experience. Workplace functions like a private version  of Facebook, with familiar features like groups, live video, and  more business-focused tools like integrations with  Salesforce and Googles suite of apps.âThere are very few apps in this space to connect everyone from  the CEO to the factory worker across a single product," said  Cross.Looking ahead, Cross said that Facebook is focused on reaching  people âbeyond the reach of traditional IT," like the Starbucks  barista or Walmart clerk who otherwise may not have an easy way  to see what is happening within their company more  broadly.Increasing the number of people who use Workplace inside a large  organization is a good thing for Facebooks pay-per-user  business model, but Cross stressed that making money isnt a  priority right now.âWeâre primarily focused on growth and engagement versus  monetization at this point," he said.
