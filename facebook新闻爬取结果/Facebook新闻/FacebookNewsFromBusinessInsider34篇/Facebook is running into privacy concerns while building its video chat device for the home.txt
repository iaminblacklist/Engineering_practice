Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg.Scott Olson/Getty  ImagesWhile developing its forthcoming video chat device for the home,  Facebook has been haunted by its own reputation as a harvester of  personal information.The company is currently building an Amazon Echo competitor with  a screen   thats internally referred to as Aloha, according to people  familiar with the matter. The plan is to release the device by  May 2018, but the date could change.During the initial development of Aloha, Facebook employees  conducted focus groups to understand how the device could be  marketed. They received overwhelming concern that Facebook would  use the device to spy on users, people familiar with the matter  said.The Alohas ability to recognize people through its camera also  caused privacy concerns. Facebook rented a house to test the  device in various rooms and people who were asked to test Aloha  said they felt uncomfortable having the device recognize them in  private spaces, like bedrooms.To assuage concerns about privacy, Facebook has considered  creative ways to market Aloha, including pitching it as a device  for letting the elderly easily communicate with their families.  The device could also be shipped without the "Facebook" name as a  way to distance itself from the larger company brand.A Facebook account will be needed to set up Aloha, which means  the social network will have access to user interactions with the  device. Facebook sees selling consumer hardware as a way for it  to more closely integrate with the lives of its 2 billion users  and inform its ad business, according to people familiar with the  companys thinking.The privacy concerns expressed during Alohas development  represent a privacy stigma Facebook will need to overcome as it    pushes further into selling consumer hardware. The company  ran into similar concerns back in 2013 when it introduced  Facebook Home, an Android phone powered by Facebook apps and made  by HTC. The phone flopped.The consumer hardware division inside Facebook responsible for  Aloha, called Building 8, is also working on a smart speaker  without a screen, wearables,   and more futuristic brain-scanning technology.Facebook declined to comment on Aloha and any unreleased  hardware.Do you know more about Building 8 and Facebooks  hardware plans?
