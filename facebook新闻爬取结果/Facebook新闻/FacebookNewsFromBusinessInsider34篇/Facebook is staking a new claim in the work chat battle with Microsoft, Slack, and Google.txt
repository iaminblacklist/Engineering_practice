Workplace  by Facebook includes specialized versions of profile pages, the  News Feed, Facebook Messenger, and even Facebook  Live.FacebookFacebook is testing a free version of Workplace, its still-in-beta  social networking service for office workers,   reports CNBC.That new version of Workplace, dubbed the "Standard" edition, will  function much the same as the paid version when it eventually  launches, but will lack certain security controls and other IT  department-friendly features.ÂOtherwise, this version will do the same thing as the   paid "Premium" edition, which launched in October, free of  charge: Provide a private, walled-off social network for you and  your coworkers to chat and collaborate, including specialized  versions of Facebook Live and the News Feed.This is a very competitive move against Facebooks rivals for the  fast-growing chat marketplace. Microsoft just launched its own    Microsoft Teams, a part of the Office 365 subscription suite.  Google responded with the introduction of   Hangouts Chat, which comes as part of the premium G Suite  services for businesses. Neither company currently offers a free  version of its work chat tools."The vision of Workplace is to connect everyone. This means  people who work only on mobile, on the go. This means large  companies with distributed workforces. This means small  businesses. This means companies in developed and developing  markets. Workplace Standard will make Workplace more accessible  and make it simpler for businesses of all sizes across the world  to get started," says Facebook spokesperson Vanessa Chan.But the company to beat in work chat right now is Slack, the $3.8  billion startup that claims 1.5 million paid users at customers  like IBM and Walmarts Jet.com.   Slack has attributed much of its growth to its own free tier,  basically giving even large customers a free taste before it  reels them in to the paid version as their usage increases. Now,  Facebook can ride the same wave.ÂPlus, this move stands to give Workplace by Facebook some  credibility with companies in a more subtle way. Lots and lots of  programmers hang out in topic-specific Slack chatrooms, taking  advantage of the companys free service, giving the app lots of  fans all over Silicon Valley and beyond.It stands to reason that lots of topic-specific groups will  similarly find reasons to use the free, private version of  Facebook promised by Workplace â giving it some credibility  and users, despite the fact that people still think of Facebook  as a consumer product.Get the latest Google stock price here.
