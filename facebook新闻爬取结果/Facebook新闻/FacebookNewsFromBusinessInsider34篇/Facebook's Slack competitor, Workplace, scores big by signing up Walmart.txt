GettyFacebook is adding Walmart, the worlds largest private employer,  to its Workplace chat tool for businesses.The move is a sign that Facebooks early efforts to compete with  companies like Microsoft and Slack in the competitive world of  enterprise software is paying off. Walmart will join the ranks of  14,000 other businesses like Starbucks and Delta that have joined  Workplace since the service first debuted nearly one year ago.Walmart decided to start using Workplace because the retail  behemoth realized that âit was time for a new generation of SaaS  apps to connect everyone in the company,â Facebooks VP of  Workplace, Julien Codorniou, told Business Insider during a  recent interview.Walmart executives have used Workplaces video capabilities  to broadcast all-hands meetings, and store  associates have shared photos of in-store display  arrangements with their colleagues to demonstrate best practices.  Because an employee doesnt even need a Facebook account  (much less a work email) to be invited by their employer onto  Workplace, Codorniou said that Facebook envisions the tool  being the first work-chat software used by many workers around  the world.So far, Facebook is seeing the most adoption on Workplaces  premium tier, which includes some features for larger  enterprises, like integration with compliance partners. The  company will begin officially charging businesses using  its larger-scale, paid tier in October, according  to Codorniou. A Facebook spokesperson declined to say how  many of the 14,000 businesses on Workplace were part of the paid  tier.Facebook has been staffing up its Workplace division in recent  months. Codorniou leads the team out of London but said that  Workplace now has several sales offices scattered around the  world.âWorkplace as a platform is a big priorityâ within  Facebook, Codorniou said.
