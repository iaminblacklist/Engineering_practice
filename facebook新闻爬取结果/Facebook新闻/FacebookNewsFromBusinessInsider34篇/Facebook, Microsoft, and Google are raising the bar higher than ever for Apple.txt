Google CEO Sundar  PichaiJustin Sullivan/Getty  ImagesWere coming up on the end of the busiest season in tech â the  month-and-a-half stretch where the biggest companies in the  market reveal their grand visions for the next 12 months at their  annual mega-conference events.Facebook kicked it off in late April with its   F8 conference, followed in early May by   Microsoft Build, and then the just-completed   Google I/O conference. This particularly Silicon Valley kind  of marathon will conclude early next month, when   Apple hosts its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).And, to be honest, this stretch has been kind of a snooze so far.  Facebook, Google, and Microsoft all used their time in the  spotlight to reiterate their commitments to artificial  intelligence and augmented reality. Its super interesting  in a philosophical sense, but itll be a while before these big  ideas congeal into finished products.But if you take a step back to look at the bigger picture,  something important is happening: In aggregate, Facebook,  Microsoft, and Google are giving Apple an ever-higher bar that  itll have to clear if it wants to continue its winning  streak into the next decade. And even the newest, shiniest iPhone  may not be able to be able to help Apple if it cant  clear that bar.ÂAt Facebooks F8 conference, Mark Zuckerberg made the    provocative declaration that augmented reality, the  technology for projecting digital images over the real world,    could render TVs and every other gadget with a screen  obsolete. Why carry a phone when your games, videos, and  conversations are projected right into your eyes?Mark  Zuckerberg shows off Facebooks concept for "smart glasses" that  overlay digital imagery on the real world.GettyThat idea alone should give Apple, which derives the vast  majority of its revenue from the iPhone, cause for concern. While  Apple is said to be working on augmented reality features  for the next iPhone, Facebook is envisioning an end to the  phone itself, possibly as soon as the next decade.Microsoft and Google both gave lip service to virtual and  augmented reality tech at their respective events. But their  events had broader themes that signal an equally important  but far more subtle threat to the   future of Apple.ÂAt its event, Microsoft showed off the Microsoft Graph, a system  for tracking the relationships between your documents and  files across all your devices. Later this year, youll be  able to start working on a Word document on your iPhone, switch  to a Windows 10 PC and pick up where you left off, and then have  the Cortana voice assistant send it to your boss.Google, at its own event, highlighted   Google Lens, a new "computer  vision" system coming to Google Photos and the Google  Assistant. Using Lens, youll be able to get more information on  a band by simply taking a picture of the marquee outside the  venue where it will play or automatically connect your phone to a  WiFi network by just taking a picture of the nearby router.ÂMicrosoft  CEO Satya Nadella speaks at the Microsoft Ignite conference in  Chicago, Illinois, May 4, 2015REUTERS/Jim YoungThe common thread here is each of these companies is collecting  lots of data on its users and is attempting to make sense of  it. Facebook knows all about your social life. Microsoft  knows all about your professional life. Google has insane insight  into your life and hobbies. All of them are using that data to  offer intensely personalized experiences that help users make  sense of the increasingly complex digital world.Google, for example, has the self-given mission to "organize the  worlds information and make it universally accessible and  useful." CEO Sundar Pichai now says that the only way to  accomplish that is to give every user their own "personal  Google." As part of that vision, each Google  user would see information thats tailored to her and  delivered just when theyre most likely to want or need it.By focusing on data rather than devices, Microsoft, Google and  Facebook lessen the risk that theyll become overly reliant on  any one product or class of gadgets. Pichais "personal  Google," exemplified today by the Google Assistant intelligent  assistant app, already works on the iPhone, Android devices and  the Google Home smart speaker. Youll soon be able to use it to  interact with home appliances. If Zuck is right about  smartphones vanishing, the Assistant is a vital hedge for  Google, which today relies heavily on the near-ubiquity of  Android.The impending arrival of this artificial intelligence-filled,  data-driven future could pose some very tough challenges for  Apple.ÂFirst and foremost, Siri, Apples own intelligent assistant, is  still frustrating to use. Alexa, which is Amazons Siri  counterpart, has won accolades for its excellent speech  recognition, and for how it allows users to easily control their  smart-home devices via voice commands. Siri, by contrast can  be inconsistent and understands you poorly. Meanwhile,   HomeKit, Apples technology for allowing its devices to  control smart-home products, has far less support from home  automation gadget makers than Apples rivals.The Amazon Echo  ShowAmazonIts not that Apple doesnt have access to any data. Siri is  probably the most-used voice assistant out there, which gives the  company a view into both users voice interactions with their  devices and the web and app searches they conduct via voice. And  lots of data flows through the Mail, Maps and other Apple apps  that come pre-installed on iPhones, iPads and Macs.What Apple is lacking is a coherent strategy for tapping into all  that information. And because of its public commitment to  privacy, the company has been   cautious about the ways it collects and uses customers data.Consequently, Apple hasnt really shown off a super-compelling  way its using artificial intelligence and data. Apple has  certainly integrated some intelligence into iOS, with Siri  suggesting apps you might want to use, Apple Maps warning you  when to leave to make it to your next meeting, and Photos tagging  faces in your pictures. Still, as any Google Photos user on an  iPhone would tell you, Appleâs default photo app is nowhere near  as intelligent as what Googleâs cooked up, and that extends to  the rest of the operating systemâs features, too.Apple has staffed up with artificial intelligence experts. But  weve   heard through the grapevine that theyre more focused on a  self-driving car project than they are on improving  Siri or making sense of the data collected from iPhone  or Mac users.Apple CEO Tim  CookREUTERS/Stephen  LamApple is probably more aware of this than anybody, and we have to  imagine that the company is working behind the scenes to up its  artificial intelligence game. The company is, after all, famous  for preferring to be the best rather than the first.And despite its problems, it would be foolish to predict Apples  demise. This wouldnt be the first time the company has  trailed behind rivals. It didnt make the first MP3 player, the  first smartphone or the first tablet, yet it eventually found  huge success in all three markets.ÂStill, with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook presenting  such compelling examples of futuristic, data-driven, intelligent  systems, Apple faces a bigger challenge than ever before. So when  its Apples turn on the big stage, itll have to show off more  than just slick new hardware â itll have to show a real vision  for the future.Get the latest Google stock price here.
