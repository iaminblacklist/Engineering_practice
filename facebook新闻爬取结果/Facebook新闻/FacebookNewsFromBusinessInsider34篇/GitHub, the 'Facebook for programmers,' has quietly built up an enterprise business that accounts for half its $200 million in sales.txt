GitHub users watch CEO Chris Wanstraths keynote at  GitHub Universe on Thursday.GitHubGitHub may have a reputation as a hub for up-and-coming  young coders, but the $2 billion company has a secret user  base driving its success: corporations. ÂAbout half of GitHubs $200 million in annual revenue comes from  businesses, according to chief strategy officer Julio Avalos. And  that number is growing as more and more software developers who  learned to code on GitHubs site get hired by corporations  and encourage their new companies to use GitHub as well.ÂThe distinction between "enterprise versus consumer is going  away," Avalos said.GitHub offers its core services â project spaces, code libraries,  and forums â for free to anyone who wants to  create open-source software. But for corporations who are  willing to pay for a service it calls GitHub Enterprise, the  company offers additional features, including private  workspaces, 24-7 support, and more dynamic cloud hosting options.Julio Avalos, GitHubs chief strategy officer, wants to  expand the companys user base by growing the number of  programmers in the US.GitHubThe company offers another paid service that allows users to keep  their code private. Subscription fees from that service account  for the other half of its total revenue.GitHub first launched its enterprise service as a way to  allow companies to store code on their own servers, rather  than in GitHubs data centers, Avalos told Business Insider.  This spring, GitHub added on an option that allows corporate  customers to store their work on the major cloud services,  including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.ÂIts enterprise service has proven to be popular. In its  recently released user  report, the company said 52% of Fortune  50 corporations are GitHub Enterprise customers, as are 45%  of those in the Fortune 100. Microsoft and Facebook run  the two largest projects on GitHubs site.The companys enterprise push comes as it is rumored to be  preparing for an IPO. With investors likely eager for a growth  story, GitHub could be pressed to offer one.ÂAvalos sees some opportunities for the company. More than  half of the Fortune 100 arent yet GitHub customers, so theres  room for growth there, he said. And he noted that the company has  set a major goal of expanding its international reach,  particularly to China.But Avalos acknowledges the company faces some growth challenges  ahead.There are only about 21 million software developers in the world,  according to market research firm IDC. GitHub already has 24  million users, although many of them likely arent actual  coders.Regardless, there just arent enough software developers  globally, Avalos said, adding that GitHub needs to help  produce more. He thinks its GitHubs responsibility to explore  ways to reach populations who might not think about computer  science as a viable career path for themselves.GitHub can help, particularly in the US, by "playing a role in  education and on-ramping," he said.
