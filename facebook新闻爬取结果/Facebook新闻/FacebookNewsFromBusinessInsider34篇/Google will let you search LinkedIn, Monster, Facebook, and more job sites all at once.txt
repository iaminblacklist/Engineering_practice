A preview of Google for Jobs.Screenshot/GoogleGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai just introduced Google for Jobs â a  forthcoming initiative from Google that will let you search for  jobs in your area, with listings pulled from sites like LinkedIn,  Facebook, and CareerBuilder.When Google for Jobs launches "in the coming weeks," it will act  as kind of a mega job-search engine that will let you sort  through multiple career sites in one go."Im personally enthusiastic for this initiative because it  addresses an important need, and perhaps our core competencies as  a company," Pichai said on stage at the Google I/O conference in  Silicon Valley.To get started with Google for Jobs, you just have to search  for something like "retail jobs" in the Google search box. Itll  pop up a bunch of job listings in your area. From there, you can  sift by date posted, the type of job, experience required, when  the job was posted, and job titles. Soon, Pichai says, youll be  able to sort by commute times, too.The idea is to use Googles artificially intelligent systems to  classify jobs. As Pichai notes, "retail" can mean anything from  sales, to store manager, to shop clerk, so Google is doing  pattern matching to get you the exact kind of jobs youre looking  for.ÂIt combines Googles mission around sorting information, with key  AI technologies, Pichai says.Its interesting that Google is taking information from rival  tech titans like Facebook and LinkedIn, a Microsoft subsidiary.  At the same time, its a new way for Google to make money by  indexing their information, while also providing those same  outside companies with a new source of job-seekers to  peruse their listings.Get the latest Google stock price here.
