Cloudflare CEO Matthew  PrinceReutersCloudflare, one  of the startups that secretly runs the internet by    handling as much as 10% of all web traffic, is making a big  upgrade that it promises will be the first step towards making  the mobile web five times faster.What Cloudflare is offering is a new way, developed with  some help from Google, to load   AMP pages â those quick-loading, single-page articles that  often pop up on your smartphone (denoted by a little lightning  bolt).If the publisher is a Cloudflare customer, this change will  mean offering readers a faster browsing experience without having  to give a ton of control to Google, which is currently is the  only company that hosts AMP pages.It might seem like a small change, but Cloudflare, backed  by investors  like Google and Microsoft, is actually putting itself right  into the middle of an industry-wide battle between Google,  Facebook, and publishers.And from Cloudflare CEO Matthew Princes perspective, at  stake is nothing less than the future of the web itself."In this particular story, the way we would see it, if  theres a villain, its Facebook," Prince says.Back in 2015, Facebook unveiled Instant Articles, its  bid to have publishers (including Business Insider)  put their articles directly into the Facebooks servers,  rather than have them hosted directly from their own  websites.ÂThe pitch was that Facebook hosting these articles would  provide a much faster, cleaner experience for mobile  readersâ 10 times faster, in  fact. From the Facebook mobile apps, tap an  article with the little lightning bolt logo, and boom, the  article loads. No muss, no fuss, no worrying about obtrusive  auto-playing videos or slow-to-load graphics.ÂIn early 2016,   Google fired back with AMP, a similar technology with a  similar sales pitch, only this time showing up in the Google  search engine on smartphones. It was a crucial tactical move for  Google: Facebook Instant Articles could draw more people looking  for news away from Google, posing a threat to its advertising  business.BII"They are fighting like crazy for the online publisher  ecosystem and the online ad ecosystem," says Prince.This   puts publishers between a rock and a hard place. If you dont  turn to these speed-boosting technologies, readers might not  click (not least because Google is now prioritizing AMP articles  in mobile search). If you do, youre basically  committing to ceding all kinds of control to Facebook, Google, or  both.Prince says that Cloudflare hosted a roundtable of CTOs  from publishers about six months ago, and the mood was decidedly  "fatalistic," as they lamented the fact that they were basically  beholden to these two tech titans.Theoretically, AMP â unlike Facebook Instant Articles â is  a set of open technologies that any publisher can use. In  practical usage, though, thats not really the case: Google  owns the only so-called "cache," the system from which  websites are served, that fully supports AMP, as they work on  perfecting the technology."They are committed to an open internet, but speed matters  and performance matters," Prince says.ÂSo while Google means well here, Prince says, AMP hasnt  been as open as publishers were perhaps hoping it would be. You  still have to give your content over to Google to take advantage,  which is suboptimal for publishers.ÂFacebookThis is where Cloudflare swoops back into the picture. By  working with Google as the first AMP partner, Cloudflare is  contributing to making AMP "a really open standard," Prince says.  And this announcement of loading mobile AMP pages seems subtle,  but its the first time that these lightning-quick pages are  served out of Cloudflares system, and not  Googles. Its something  publishers have been asking for.Given that many sites are already Cloudflare customers, this  announcement representatives the first few tentative steps  towards giving publishers the option of hosting AMP pages where  they want, how they want, without changing anything or ceding any  additional control to Google or Facebook. Prince expects other  companies will sign on, too.A big source of concern for the publishing industry is how to  monetize formats like Facebook Instant Articles or Google AMP,  given that they dont support online advertisements as we mostly  know them today.To Princes mind, thats actually a boon: Readers love these  super-fast articles not least because they  dont support annoying, obtrusive, or even insecure online ads.  With Cloudflares help, Prince expects that AMP will start to  become a major standard on the web, and its a great chance for  the industry to kind of start over.Which is also why Facebook Instant Articles pose a threat, too,  from his perspective. Facebook is a totally closed system, with  Instant Articles only working from within Facebooks own apps,  while Google AMP is a way to rebuild the whole, open web."This is an opportunity to clean up [the web] through the AMP  specification," Prince says.Get the latest Google stock price here.
