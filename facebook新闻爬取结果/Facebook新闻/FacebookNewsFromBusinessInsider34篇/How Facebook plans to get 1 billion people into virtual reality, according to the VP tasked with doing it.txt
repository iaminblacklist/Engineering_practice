Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introducing the Oculus Go  headset.FacebookDespite tepid interest from consumers so far, Facebook still  believes it can turn virtual reality into the next big thing."We want to get a billion people in virtual reality," CEO Mark  Zuckerberg said onstage at the companys annual Oculus VR  conference for developers this week in California.The goal is an exceptionally ambitious one even for  Facebook, which already boasts 2 billion users.Consider the current state of VR: Research firm  Canalys recently  estimated that only two million VR headsets were  shipped globally in 2016, with Oculus accounting for  400,000 of those shipments. (Facebook has yet to  publicly disclose how many Oculus headsets it has  sold.)Facebooks latest VR bet is its Oculus Go headset,  which will start at $199 when it ships in early  2018. The Oculus Go is intended to fill the "sweet spot"  between expensive, higher-end VR systems like the Oculus Rift and  lightweight headsets like Samsungs Gear VR, Zuckerberg said  during his keynote earlier this week."Itâs hands down the most accessible way to get into VR,"  Facebooks Oculus chief, Hugo Barra, told Business Insider in an  interview after the keynote. "Weâve designed it with comfort as  the most important target we wanted to hit."Oculus Go represents just one of Facebooks multi-pronged efforts  to grow its VR business, which currently lags behind  competitors like Sony and HTC. Oculus is also starting to work  directly with businesses and is developing an  untethered version of its flagship, most expensive Rift headset.The task of leading Oculus now falls on Barra, who  joined Facebook six months ago with the newly-created title "VP  of VR" after serving stints at Xiaomi and Googles Android  division.Hugo  Barra and Mark Zuckerberg in Facebooks VR app,  Spaces.FacebookOne of Barras recent announcements is the Oculus for Business  Program, which allows enterprise customers to buy bulk  orders of Oculus headsets for commercial use.Oculus is already working with companies like Cisco and Audi  to use its headsets in their workplaces, and expects to  raise general consumer awareness of VR through the program.Thats because some of these businesses are creating VR  apps for their own customers, Barra said. For instance, Audi  is using Oculus Rift headsets to give customers virtual car demos  at some of its dealerships."We think that working with some of these business is going to  create great consumer awareness for VR in general," Barra said.Such plans are not unique. Microsoft is doing much the same by  targeting its augmented reality headset, HoloLens, to  businesses as well. But the program is a new direction for  Oculus, which has strictly focused on reaching consumers prior.Meanwhile, Facebook will also try to raise awareness for VR in  other ways. Oculus will run ad campaigns for its forthcoming Go  headset and the lowered cost of its higher-end Rift system.While Facebook currently has no plans to open retail stores, that  idea isnt out of the question either, Barra said. "I think itâs  plausible, but certainly not something weâre thinking about  discussing at this point. Itâs not a bad idea at all.âÂIn fact, Facebook tested the retail idea a bit last winter,  when it   showed off its Oculus Rift technology in various  short-term pop-up stores around the country.Facebook  Oculus Rift pop-up store at Denver International  Airport.Business  InsiderWhile Oculus faces mounting pressure from competitors like Sony  and HTC, the VR division has also undergone its own string  of hardships since it was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion in  2014.Prominent VR evangelist and  Oculus cofounder Palmer  Luckey was forced out of the company  earlier this year after it was discovered that he   secretly funded anti-Hillary Clinton advertisements around  the 2016 election.Aside from Luckeys departure, Oculuss other top leadership has  been through a lot of other changes. CEO Brendan Irbe stepped  down in December 2016 (he apparently still works on the Rift, but  was noticeably absent from the Oculus conference this past week).  Its head of mobile VR, Jon Thomason, left for Uber in  September 2017 after less than a year on the job.Palmer  Luckey.Facebook.com/oculusvrAnd back in February, Oculus  was ordered  to pay game maker ZeniMax $500 million in  damages for a lost lawsuit. Facebook is in the process of  appealing the ruling.For now, Oculus has to battle increasingly fierce  competition from gaming-focused headsets like Sonys  PlayStation VR. Its untethered Santa Cruz headset, while  impressive during a brief demo, doesnt have a ship date or price  point yet. And Oculus Go wont ship in time for this years  holiday season.Barra points to the 2,000 apps, including titles from the likes  of Pixar, and over 100 million downloads on the Oculus platform  as evidence that VR is already catching on outside of the  early-adopter crowd. Zuckerberg has said Facebook plans to spend  billions of dollars over the next several years on developing  VR along with paying developers to create apps and games."Awareness comes with having a wide product portfolio," said  Barra. "Amazing things take time to build."
