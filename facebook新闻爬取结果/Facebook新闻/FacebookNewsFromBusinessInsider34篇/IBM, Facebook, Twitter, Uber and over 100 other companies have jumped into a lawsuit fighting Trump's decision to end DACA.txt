AP  Photo/Manu FernandezOn Wednesday, the tech industry stepped up its efforts to keep  800,000 people from being deported as a result of the  Trumps Administrations decision to end the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals program.IBM, Twitter, Uber, Facebook and other companies are  officially weighing in to support   a lawsuit filed by California, Minnesota, Maryland and  Maine. The suit challenges the Trump administrations  decision to end the controversial Obama-era policy known as DACA.This brief attempts to make a business case that  ditching DACA would harm the US economy. Heres one line:"Just as DACA sent a powerful message of inclusion, its  rescission tells the immigrants who have been integral to the  growth and development of our society and economy for decades  that they are no longer welcome here. As a result, DACAâs  rescission will reduce the future ability of U.S. companies to  attract individuals from around the world to support Americaâs  continued economic growth and prosperity."DACA allows illegal immigrants to be apply to become  exempt from deportation if they entered the US as children under  the age of 16 and stayed out of trouble. Proponents of  DACA say that many of these immigrants were brought to the US by  their parents as very young children and know no country other  than the US as their home.ÂSome 800,000 people are covered under DACA and are known as  "dreamers," a reference to the Dream Act which was proposed  legislation during Obamas term that would have given them  legal immigration status and a path to citizenship. The  gridlocked Congress under Obama never passed that legislation.  But under the DACA policy, dreamers are still able to get  work permits and attend school in the US. The dreamers also pay  taxes.In September, the Trump Administration announced that it would  end the DACA policy in six months for those already covered by  it, queuing them up to be deported unless Congress passed  legislation in that time frame to cover them.Much of the tech industry   became vocally opposed to the end of DACA, with executives  from Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, Facebook and Apple tweeting  their support for dreamers in September.That decision also set  off at least five lawsuits challenging it, including the one  filed by California and other states.But tech companies, especially IBM, are doing more than just  tweeting. IBM has been waging an all-out campaign trying  to convince Congress to pass a law that allows dreamers to  get legal status. IBM employs more than 30 dreamers. CEO Ginny  Rometty has been personally talking to members of Congress as  well as people in the Trump administration â Rometty was a member  of Trumps now-disbanded business advisory group.  And IBM  has been targeting influential lawmakers with ads and sending  its dreamer employees to personally meet with lawmakers and tell  their stories.For instance, one of them "worked around-the-clock remote  shifts to ensure continuity  of IBM services when  Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston," IBMs Christopher  Padilla, Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs told  Business Insider in an emailed statement.This latest effort, an amicus brief signed by multiple companies  in support of Californias lawsuit, is another way to crank up  the pressure.IBM certainly isnt alone in its efforts. Google, Microsoft,  Facebook, Uber, Marriott International and other big U.S.  companies are lobbying in various ways, including launching  a new lobbying coalition, Coalition for the American  Dream earlier this month.Many are also supporting FWD.us, a pro-immigration reform  lobbying group founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2013."IBM is actively urging Congress to find a permanent    legislative solution to enable Dreamers to stay in the United    States. We have also urged the court in this case to find    that DACAs revocation was unfounded. The program is due    to begin phasing out in less than five months, and we are    committed to providing as much stability and predictability as    possible to DACA recipients who work    at IBM,"  Padilla said.Heres a full copy of the brief.DACA 108 Companies Amicus Brief by JulieB188 on ScribdGet the latest IBM stock price here.
