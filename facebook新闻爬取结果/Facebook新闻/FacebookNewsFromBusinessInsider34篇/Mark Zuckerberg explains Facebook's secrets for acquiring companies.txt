A rival tech giant,   believed to have also been Google, offered WhatsApp more  money in an attempt to steal the messaging app away from  Zuckerberg.Facebook ended up successfully closing deals on Oculus and  WhatsApp within a few weeks, beating out Google twice.Zuckerberg gave rare insight into how he approaches acquiring  other companies during a public testimony in a Dallas courtroom  on Tuesday. He was there to   testify in a lawsuit between Oculus and the video game  publisher ZeniMax.Here are Zuckerbergs four main acquisition strategies, which  Business Insider obtained through a court transcript of his  testimony:Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom with Mark  Zuckerberg.FacebookWhile Facebook conducted its legal due diligence on Oculus over  one weekend, Zuckerberg explained that he usually approaches big  acquisitions by first establishing friendships with the founders  of the companies hes looking to scoop up."In reality what is happening with all of these, in Instagram and  WhatsApp and Oculus, they are kind of things that weve been  thinking about for a long time," he said."And Ive been building relationships, at least in  Instagram and the WhatsApp cases, for years with the founders and  the people that are involved in these companies," he  said, "which made it so that when it became time or when we  thought it was the right time to move, we felt like we had a good  amount of context and had good relationships so that we could  move quickly, which was competitively important and why a lot of  these acquisitions, I think, came to us instead of our  competitors and ended up being very good acquisitions  over time that a lot of competitors wished they had gotten  instead."Mark  Zuckerberg, left, tries the Oculus-powered Gear VR headset with  Brendan Iribe.FacebookZuckerberg said that the main reason he was able to acquire  Oculus for less than the $4 billion its team originally wanted  was because he pitched a vision of collaboration between the two  companies that everyone bought into."The most important thing was aligning and getting excited about  a shared vision and about how were going to work together," he  said. "Or if they built the hardware and we built the  experiences, how that could be better than either of us working  separately."If this [the deal] is going to happen, its not going to  be because we offer a lot of money, although were going to have  to offer a fair price for the company that is more than what they  felt like they could do on their own. But they also need to feel  like this was actually going to help their mission,  right?"The shared vision has to go both ways, Zuckerberg explained."Theres a lot of anxiety in these deals, right?" he said. "I  mean, if youre going to pay $19 billion for a company or $2  billion for a company, you clearly have to really believe in it."Snap  CEO Evan Spiegel, whose company is preparing for an initial  public offering that could value its business at $25  billion.Getty/Michael  KovacWhile he prefers to sell a founder on a shared vision, Zuckerberg  admitted to sometimes scaring small startups by making them  imagine how difficult it would be to run their businesses alone."Thats less my thing, but I think if you are trying to  help convince people that they want to join you, helping them  understand all the pain that they would have to go through to  build it out independently is a valuable tactic," he  said.Its unclear whether he used that tactic on Evan Spiegel, who  famously turned down on Zuckerbergs $3 billion offer to buy  Snapchat a few years ago.WhatsApp cofounder Jan  Koum.David Ramos / Getty  ImagesWhen Zuckerbergs top dealmaker, Amin Zoufonoun, warned him that  doing legal due diligence on Oculus over one weekend carried  "some risk," Zuckerberg told him to keep "pushing forward until  we have something we can sign on a moments notice.""When youre making deals and it is a competitive situation, you  often dont have a lot of time," he said.That line of thinking is consistent with Facebooks old company  motto, "move fast and break things." Its also a key strategy to  keep competitors from beating Facebook to sign on the dotted  line."Some of the bigger acquisitions that we have done, like  Instagram and WhatsApp, which were each more than a billion  dollars, we had to move quickly because other companies â whether  it was Google or, you know, Twitter or Apple, or whatever the  companies were â were also trying to talk to these companies and  buy them," Zuckerberg said."And often, if a company knows were offering something,  they will offer more," he continued. "So being  able to move quickly not only increases our chance of being able  to get a deal done if we want to, but it makes it so we dont  have end up having to pay a lot more because the process drags  out."I think some companies might just take many weeks or months to  review some stuff, and I think one of the things weve always  prided ourselves on and one of the things that has always worked  well for Facebook is that weve just been able to be flexible and  move quickly on important things. And thats served us very  well."
