Over the last week or so, both   Facebook and   Microsoft laid out their visions for the future of  virtual reality, which they both see as the next big thing in  tech.Heres something funny, though. This next big thing looks a lot  like Microsoft Bob, an operating system from 1995 thats also  considered one of the biggest tech flops of all time.Dont believe me? Okay. Heres Microsoft Bob:YouTube/ScreenshotThe idea behind Microsoft Bob was simple: Windows was too  technical for mainstream users to understand, so Microsoft  experimented with a simpler, more intuitive interface. At one  point, Bob was headed up by no less than Melinda French â  the Microsoft manager who would go on to marry Bill Gates."So our big idea with Microsoft Bob was to turn your  desktop into something everyone understood: a house. To write,  you clicked on a pen and paper; to check the date, you clicked  the calendar on the wall â that type of thing," as Melinda Gates  described the project in a   recent LinkedIn post.Keep that in mind as you watch this video showing Facebooks  revamped Oculus Home, the interface for its Oculus virtual  reality headsets, which will be released in beta this December:And heres the Microsoft Mixed Reality Cliff House, which is how  youll access different programs in   Mixed Reality on Windows 10 when a big update drops on  October 17:MicrosoftSo maybe the notion of having a house as the computer interface  was just ahead of its time. Maybe you just needed to strap a  headset on to feel like you were actually in the house, first.Either way, it was too late to save Microsoft Bob. The reviews  were brutal, with most reviewers decrying it as too simplistic to  get anything done. And many users found that the cartoon animals  that acted as Bobs help system were too cloying and annoying.  After about a year on the market, Bob was quietly  discontinued.Â"Our failures tend to result from markets being too small," joked  Bill Gates in a 1997 newspaper column. "Unfortunately, the  [Microsoft Bob] software demanded more performance than typical  computer hardware could deliver at the time and there wasnt an  adequately large market. Bob died."Bill  and Melinda GatesWikimedia  CommonsBut apart from the union of Bill and Melinda Gates, Bob had  a few other lasting effects: Bobs cast of cartoon characters  would evolve into   Clippy, the reviled help assistant in old versions of  Microsoft Office. Bob was also responsible for the creation of    Comic Sans, now considered one of the worlds most hated  fonts."So youâre welcome for that," writes Melinda Gates in her  2017 LinkedIn post.You can read Gates full post on Bob, and the lessons  learned from its failure,   over at LinkedIn.
