I needed both to  start my recovery," Sandberg  wrote Tuesday in a Facebook post."Today, were taking another step," Sandberg said, before  announcing Facebooks newest family-friendly policies.According to the Facebook executive, effective immediately the  company is extending its paid bereavement leave to up to 20 days  to grieve the death of an immediate family member and up to 10  days to grieve the death of an extended family member. Facebook  is also expanding its paid family leave to up to six  weeks for employees to care for a sick relative. Finally, the  company is also introducing paid family sick time, which offers  employees three days to take care of a family member with a  short-term illness like the flu.The news comes at a critical time for American families: Under  the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, qualifying American are  guaranteed 12 weeks of "reasonable" leave for certain family and  medical situations including caring for a family member with a  serious health condition.While the law requires companies with 50 or more employees to  provide new parents with 12 weeks of leave, it doesnt require  this leave to be paid, and the policy is also restricted to  full-time employees who have been with the company for more than  a year, which, all told, applies to about 60% of workers in the  US.Though the number of companies  expanding their paid parental leave benefits is rising,  Sandberg acknowledged that its less common for employees to get  paid time off to care for sick loved ones, saying that the US  needs public policies "that make it easier for people to  care for their children and aging parents and for families to  mourn and heal after loss.""People should be able both to work and be there for their  families," Sandberg wrote. "No one should face this  trade-off."Considering the USs lack of federal paid family leave  policy, Sandberg said companies need to take the lead and  support families with their own paid leave policies, which she  said wouldnt just be nice to do, but would also improve the  bottom line by increasing employee loyalty and performance."I hope more companies will join us and others making similar  moves, because Americas families deserve support," Sandberg  wrote.See Sandbergs full Facebook post below:
