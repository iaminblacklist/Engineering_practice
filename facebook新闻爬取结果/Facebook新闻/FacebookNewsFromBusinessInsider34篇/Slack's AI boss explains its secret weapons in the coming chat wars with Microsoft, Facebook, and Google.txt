Slack  head of Search, Learning, and Intelligence Noah  WeissSlackThree years ago, a startup named Slack came out of nowhere to  become whats believed to be the fastest-growing business  software company ever, hitting a $1 billion valuation within the  first 8 months of its existence.Today,   Slack is a $3.8 billion business with over 800 employees, and  a growing roster of paying customers that include IBM, Walmarts  Jet.com, and, yes, Business Insider. For many companies, chat is  the way people are getting things done. Slack wasnt the first  company to do chat at work, but its certainly the most  visible.ÂAnd so, tech titans like   Microsoft,   Google, and   Facebook have all launched their own work chat apps, trying  to crush  Slack before its too late. Under that pressure, Slack is  doubling down on its biggest advantage: Generally speaking,  people actually enjoy using it, which isnt often the case with  software meant for use in the office.Enter Noah Weiss, former Googler and Senior VP of Product  Management at Foursquare, who now leads Slacks Search, Learning  and Intelligence team out of the   companys spiffy new New York City offices. Its his team  thats going to be making much of the "magic" that keeps users  glued to Slack, even as the alternatives proliferate.Â"Slack is a very bizarre enterprise software company," says  Weiss. "And I mean bizarre in the best possible way."Because people are using Slack all workday, every workday,  theres an astonishing amount of information thats already  flowing through the app. Not just text, but the photos and links  and documents that your coworkers are sharing with each other."All of that data exhaust is something that we think we can tap  into to make Slack itself smarter," says Weiss.Slack already integrates some of that, with smarter search  suggestions. And users can opt-in to receive regular  suggestions for chat rooms within their company â whether that  room is for a special sales project populated by the people they  talk to every day, or for "Game of Thrones" fans.The data thats feeding the beast is largely coming from outside  apps, says Weiss. For example, he says, teams at Slack itself use  Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Dropbox Paper, and Quip, just for  the creation and sharing of documents. Regardless which app  employees use to create the file, they use Slack to share it  with coworkers.ÂSlack CEO Stewart  ButterfieldCraig Barritt/Getty  Images"Slack ends up being pretty good connective tissue for this  increasingly diverse set of tools," says Weiss.ÂOver time, Weiss says, Slack can really start to "learn" things  about users based on the things they send around. If you share a  lot of spreadsheets with "expenses" in the title, you probably  work in accounting. If you post a lot of links about Elon Musk,  youre probably into space. And so on.All of which comes back to helping people love Slack more,  explains Weiss. All of this data will help its users sift through  the noise that comes with everyday conversation, and find the  answers theyre looking for, more quickly. Once Slack  "understands" the relationships between people and files, it can  subtly point you towards the right answers, without requiring you  to change the way you work."There is tremendous collective knowledge building up in Slack,"  says Weiss.Microsoft, in particular, is hard at work on similar principles.  In 2016, the company introduced the   Microsoft Graph, which, as you may guess from the name,  traces the relationships between documents and coworkers the same  way that Facebooks famed social graph does for your  friends.ÂStill, Weiss believes that Slack has a few advantages. First and  foremost, its been doing it longer, and claims a leading 5  million daily active users. That means lots more data flowing in,  which means it can release new, smarter, time-saving features  faster.Slacks  channel recommendations are an early version of how the company  wants to use existing data to make it much  smarter.Slack"We kind of created this category; we have the most usage in this  category," says Weiss.Furthermore, Weiss says, Slack is way more focused than  Facebook, Google or Microsoft, all of whom support a  plethora of messaging apps beyond whatever it is they offer to  office workers. For Slack, messaging is literally all they do.  Weiss team has one mission, and its not powering a search  engine or whatnot â its building a chat app that helps  people be more productive."When you think about how Slack itself is wired, we are here on  this Earth to do this one thing," Weiss says.Get the latest Google stock price here.
