Thomson  ReutersThese are the quiet times.From April to June, techs biggest companies all held their  annual mega-events, laying out their grand visions for the next  12 months or so.ÂFacebook kicked it off in late April with its   F8 conference, followed by   Microsoft Build, then the   Google I/O conference, and Apples  Worldwide Developers Conference finished things off. Amazon  doesnt really hold events, but it unveiled two new Amazon Echo  smart speakers during that period for good measure.And things will get exciting again, sooner than you know it. This  Fall, Apple is expected to reveal a   10th-anniversary iPhone, Google will likely reveal a   revamped Pixel smartphone, and Microsoft is expected to hold  another one of its regular late-October Surface computer press  conferences.In the meantime, theres not much to do but reflect on what weve  learned so far this year about the future of tech. And beyond the  hype and the hyperbole, were starting to see the very earliest  stages of a battle for the next phase of computing.Because while Apple and Google may dominate the smartphone market  today, technologies like augmented reality present whole-new  platforms where theres no clear winner. So Amazon, Microsoft,  and Facebook, having missed out on owning a mobile platform, are  doing their damndest to   hasten the end of the smartphone â and the end of Apple and  Googles duopoly, while theyre at it.Every major technological shift has created big opportunities for  the few entrepreneurs who see it coming early â in the  seventies, Apple and Microsoft made big bets that the PC would be  a much bigger market than gigantic room-sized mainframes, while  the   mainframe industry decried the PC itself as a fad. We see who  won that one.Similarly, Microsoft didnt fully realize the potential of  smartphones, until well after Google and Apple proved them wrong.  Now, Googles Android is the most popular operating system in the  world, full stop. And the iPhone has propelled Apple  to record profits and to the status  as the company to beat in tech.Well, it seems like time is a flat circle. Right now, were  seeing the earliest growing pains of augmented reality and  virtual reality â tech that overlays the digital world onto  our human senses. It means information, projected into your  eyes and ears, as you need it. Why carry a phone when Netflix and  WhatsApp are floating in front of you?Apple ARkit allows apps to overlay digital imagery into  the real world.Made With  ARKitSome call it a fad, or just something thats too new and  untested to be considered a real threat to the smartphone.  And yet, theres a veritable arms race to build these augmented  reality platforms of the future.Amazons Alexa is primarily thought of as a digital voice  assistant, but having a virtual "person" tell you the time and  weather definitely qualifies as augmented reality. Microsoft has  its reality-bending HoloLens "hologram" goggles.   Facebook and Snapchat have both built augmented reality  straight into the camera. Even Google-backed startup   Magic Leap thinks its yet-to-released goggles have a shot at  becoming a new platform.The net result is a race to build whatever is going to do  the smartphone what the PC did to the mainframe. What these  companies all have in common is that they missed the boat on  building smartphone operating systems of their own. Now, its on  them to build whatever comes next.Apple and Google are well aware of the threat and are not  standing still.Apple has ARkit, a system for building augmented reality into  iPhone apps, using the phones built-in camera. Its  technologically robust enough and easy enough to use that  developers love it, giving Apple a nice foothold in  augmented reality. If and when   Apple releases smart glasses, those apps will come right  over.Google has various augmented reality efforts in the works,  including Project Tango. And although the first version of the  Google Glass headset flopped, if Google figures out how to revamp  the device, it will have a vehicle to extend Android into the AR  realm.ÂMicrosofts HoloLens goggles project three-dimensional  imagery into your field of view.MicrosoftIn a weird way, going on the defensive like this almost gives  Apple a perverse incentive to replace the iPhone: If   Apple can build the next great hardware platform itself, it  means that Amazon cant do it with Alexa, and Microsoft cant do  it with HoloLens.ÂIn the meantime, as we appreciate all the new hardware and  software goodies coming out later this year, keep the perspective  that everything were seeing now is the first salvo in a  computing war that will rage for the next decade and beyond.Get the latest Google stock price here.
