Smytes Pete  HuntYouTube/Facebook  DevelopersRemember back in 2012, when Facebook stunned the world by  spending $1 billion to buy the 13-person startup Instagram?The purchase seems almost quaint now, when the Valley is overrun  with billion-dollar startups, but it blew the minds of Silicon  Valley at the time.It was also the turning point in the career for one early  Facebook employee, Pete Hunt.Today Hunt is the cofounding CEO of a security startup called Smyte.But he is better known as one of the fathers of a Facebook-born  technology for programmers called React. React is one of the most  popular open source projects Facebook has ever released and it  turned Hunt into a star in the web development world.All thanks to Instagram. And while his startup isnt based  on React, its early success is a direct result of how he  turned Reacts initial haters into fans.Back in the summer of 2012, Hunt became known inside of Facebook  for working on its photo and video features. He and his  team had spent the previous year thinking of Instagram as  the enemy.ÂPete  HuntPete HuntThen Instagram was   suddenly a massive and controversial part of Facebook  and Hunt was assigned to bring Instagram into the Facebook  fold."I was the first engineer to go over from Facebook to Instagram.  I was the corporate drone," Smyte tells Business Insider. "They  were super nice. But it definitely was like I was the first  external person dropped into their tight-knit team."Hunt was tasked with building Instagrams first website.ÂThe first step was bringing it into Facebooks "trust and  safety" systems â the tools that protect users from bullies,  and fraud, as well as watching for evidence of hate speech  or crimes.The second step was to solve a serious technical problem.  The companys database was struggling under the load of all  those photos, so to build a website that could grow as  Instagram grew, he couldnt just add more computer servers.  He was going to have to build the app using JavaScript, which  makes the PC do most of the work of rendering the photos,  not the servers.He started exploring the best ways to do that and came across  another Facebook employee, Jordan Walke, who had been  working on a "cool" side project to do this, Hunt describes.It wasnt a polished tool but he bet Instagrams website on  it anyway. This became React. Hunt was hooked on React and kept  adding features and improvements. Word about React grew at  Facebook."More and more products inside Facebook had this same set of  problems and wanted to use this technology. This includes mobile  search and ad placement," he says.ÂBy 2013, React had become really popular inside of Facebook and  Hunt was known as one of its gurus. The React team decided  to share their creation â free and open source  â with the  world at a big Javascript developers conference."By this time, this technology had been through the ringer. We  knew it was awesome and everyone was super excited about  announcing it," he said.But when they showed it off, people hated it.While the team was on stage demonstrating React, the  reaction was merciless, Hunt recalls."Everyone was being super mean on Twitter and Hacker News," he  says.Thats because React involved a new way to organize a web project  that involved mixing and matching code written in different  formats, something that was always considered to be a major,  sloppy no-no. And the team was skewered for it.It was demoralizing.React  has become one of the most popular open source tools on the site  that stores and shares tools, GitHubGitHubHunt, who knew how React was helping Facebook, wasnt having  it.So he created a talk that addressed all of the  criticisms and hit the road giving that talk at  other Javascript conferences.He also took on the haters directly on Twitter and  Hacker News."I read every comment and replied to every one," he said.After a while, other people started replying as well, and  posting the YouTube link to his talks.React took off. And he became a very popular speaker."I was flying around the world to different countries every  month giving talks. I was flying business class,  the conferences were paying for me to come. I felt like a  rockstar," he said.Until one night, when he was at a conference party in Barcelona  at 4 a.m. and he looked around at his adoring fans and realized  "It was me and a bunch of nerds. And I was like, well, I sort of  made it."He knew he wanted to do something bigger. The startup bug had  bit.He decided his startup would not be based on React but on  trust and safety, the first thing Instagram had had to figure  out."Thereâs a trail of dead companies because they couldnât do trust  and safety. Yik Yak, Secret, and Twitter is struggling with  this too, the abuse problem," he said.Smyte  founders, Julian Tempelsman (left); Pete Hunt (middle); Josh  Yudaken (right)SmyteHis success with React and Instagram "was enough for me to  have courage to leave Facebook. But I didnt think I was the  guy to build it. I needed a cofounder to help me. But even as a  so-called celebrity rockstar, I couldnât get anyone to quit their  job and join me," he said.He knew the cofounder he wanted, too: Julian Tempelsman. He had  met him on the stairs of his apartment wearing a Toga when they  all attended a party in his apartment building. It turned  out Tempelsman was working on similar security systems at  Google and they spent that evening talking about a potential  startup.But Tempelsman didnt want to leave Google.  After almost a year of pestering, Hunt told him, "Iâll quit  my job and weâll do the fund raise and if it doesnât happen,  you dont need to quit your job. If it does, you can still  come in as an equal partner" he said.He met his other cofounder, Josh Yudaken, at  Instagram. Yudaken was itching to go out on his own,  got curious and when Hunt quit Facebook, he jumped in.It didnt take long for Tempelsman to join, too. And it  didnt take long to find some seed money."The seed founder was a friend of a friend of a  Google cofounder. I had lunch with him and he wrote a check," he  said.Smyte got accepted into the startup factory known as  YCombinator and quickly raised another $2.25 million from a  number of backers including Instagram VC Steve Anderson at  Baseline. It just raised another $4 million A  round last month.He still contributes to React. And it turns out that his  fame in that world, and the way he chased down the haters is  helping Smyte win business."My classic move to get into companies [for a sales meeting] is I  see question on Stack Overflow," he says, referring to the  website where developers ask each other questions. "I tell them,  Iâm happy to go in and give your guys a tech talk on React, and  since Im doing you a favor, can I meet with your team for 20  minutes? It gets me in the door."ÂWhile the startup isnt profitable yet the tactic is  working. "We have over tripled our revenue in the  past 6 months. We have dozens of customers, and around 100  million monthly active users and monitor tens of thousands of  events per second," Hunt said.Smyte formally launched its product in 2015 and has landed such  customers as Indiegogo, GoFundMe, Quora, Medium, Meetup, Task  Rabbit and others.
