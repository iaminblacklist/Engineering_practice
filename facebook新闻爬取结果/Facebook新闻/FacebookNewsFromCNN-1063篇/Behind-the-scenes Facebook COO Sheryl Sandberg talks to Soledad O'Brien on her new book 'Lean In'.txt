EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Watch part two of Soledad O'Brien's interview with Sheryl Sandberg on "Starting Point" at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, March 19th. There has been much debate over a controversial new book written by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. It's called "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead." The book is filled with advice encouraging women to be leaders in the workplace and rid themselves of the stereotypes that hold them back. Some critics say, though, that Sandberg's is unrealistic for women who are trying to balance work and family. Soledad O'Brien had a chance to sit down with Sandberg in Facebook's New York office. She asked about Sandberg's reaction to the controversy surrounding her book and how men can help women "lean in" in their careers. In the gallery above, check out our behind-the-scenes photographs from the shoot.
