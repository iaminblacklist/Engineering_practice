Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld is getting a smaller bonus this year, a reduction the company says is directly linked to the bungled Facebook IPO. The CEO's bonus for 2012 will be $1.35 million, a 62% drop from the previous year. The Facebook episode in particular cost Grefield $542,100. Greifeld is paid a base salary of $1 million. His total compensation, including stock, totaled $8.9 million last year, an 18% increase over 2011. Anna Ewing, an executive vice president at Nasdaq, had her bonus docked by $263,625.
