Facebook is getting out of the business of gift card peddling.  You will no longer be prompted with a wrapped-present icon to send your friends a Starbucks or Target gift card on their birthdays -- Facebook's Gifts service is set to be discontinued.  Launched in September 2012, Gifts will no longer be available as of August 12, according to a Re/code report. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Gifts app was already scaled down from allowing users to purchase and send tangible presents, to exclusively e-gift cards activated by digital codes.

The Gifts news comes just days after the company revealed its new "Buy" button -- an embeddable feature similar to the "Like" button that allows users to make purchases from a selection of small businesses partnered with Facebook.  Facebook's recently revealed second quarter results showed the company's major growth in mobile. The social network's experimentation with e-commerce ventures may present another opportunity for engagement with smartphone users -- both vendors and shoppers.
