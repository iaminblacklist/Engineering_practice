Fat is no longer a feeling, at least on Facebook.  The company removed the "feeling fat" emoticon Tuesday after a backlash from a group that said it makes fun of people who feel overweight. More than 16,700 people signed a petition on Change.org demanding Facebook take the emoticon down. "We've heard from our community that listing 'feeling fat' as an option for status updates could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders," Facebook said in a statement. Before Tuesday, the "feeling fat" face was one of many emoticon options for Facebook users to post in a status update. The activist group, Endangered Bodies, considers the change a win.  "This success shows us that people together can challenge the cultural messages that are so damaging to our ability to love ourselves and live comfortably in our bodies," wrote Catherine Weingarten, who spearheaded the petition.  There are still dozens of other emoticon options for Facebook users addicted to updating their statuses. They can still feel excited and loved, as well as drunk, broken, and incomplete.
