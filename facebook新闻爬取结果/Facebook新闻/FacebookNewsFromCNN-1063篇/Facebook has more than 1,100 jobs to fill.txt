Facebook has 1,159 job openings listed on its corporate site, as the social network company continues its aggressive growth plans. The company's staffing level jumped by 44% in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, according to a company filing, growing Facebook's headcount to 8,348 jobs as of that date. Facebook's year-end employment level is not yet available. Many of the job openings on the company's site are for advertising sales. There are 126 ad sales job postings listed.  But Facebook's move into new areas is also fueling its growth. Its Oculus virtual reality unit has 52 job openings listed, and its effort to have drones provide Internet access to different parts of the globe has the company looking to hire aerospace mechanical technicians, avionics engineers and a flight test manager.
