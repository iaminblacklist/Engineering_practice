Facebook has rejoined the race for India's next billion internet users with a promise of cheap WiFi. The company said Thursday it was planning to roll out 20,000 WiFi hotspots across the country over the coming months in partnership with Indian mobile provider Bharti Airtel. It has been testing the new initiative for about two years. Customers can sign up for daily, weekly or monthly plans that cost about 10 rupees ($0.15) a day. Facebook already has 700 hotspots across four Indian states through other internet providers.
