So much for football on Facebook. The social media giant has withdrawn its bid to live stream NFL games next season, according to a person in a position to know. The news was first reported by Bloomberg. Both Facebook and the NFL declined to comment. Facebook's withdrawal comes less than a month after it had put in a bid for the league's "Thursday Night Football" package. It was competing with Amazon, Verizon, and other streaming video outlets.

CBS and NBC recently agreed to pay roughly $450 million combined each year for the next two years of "Thursday Night Football" on TV. The rights to live-stream the Thursday games are being sold separately.
