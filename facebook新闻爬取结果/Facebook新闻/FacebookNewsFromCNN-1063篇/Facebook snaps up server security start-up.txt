After a year filled with news of government spying and massive cyberattacks, Facebook is stepping up its defenses. The social network announced Thursday that it was acquiring cybersecurity start-up PrivateCore, which builds software to protect server data.  The Palo Alto, Calif., based company was founded in 2012 by security experts formerly of Google and VMware. Joe Sullivan, Facebook's chief security officer, said PrivateCore's technology "protects servers from persistent malware, unauthorized physical access, and malicious hardware devices."
