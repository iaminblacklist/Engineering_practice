More than a year after its botched initial public offering, Facebook's stock continues to race higher. Shares topped $50 for the first time Thursday.  Facebook's stock is now up 88% in 2013. It's a stunning reversal for a stock that was a big disappointment shortly after its May 2012 IPO. After being priced at $38, Facebook shares dropped more than 35% within a few months, hurting investors who clamored to buy shares. But investors who were willing to buy and hold have been handsomely rewarded. The stock is now 32% above its IPO price.
