Facebook is the latest Silicon Valley company to stand with Apple, which is fighting an order to help the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. On Thursday, Facebook issued a statement saying such demands from the government "create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies' efforts to secure their products." Although Facebook reinforced that it does comply with lawful requests from authorities, "we will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems." The company also condemned terrorism: "Those who seek to praise, promote, or plan terrorist acts have no place on our services."
