Love it or hate it, Facebook's live video streaming is a hit. It lets you tune into a cousin's wedding from halfway around the world or watch Martha Stewart bake cookies.  Launched widely in late January and now available in 60 countries, the feature lets anyone broadcast a live video on their Facebook news feed from a smartphone. It's available to regular users, but has been particularly appealing for media companies, famous or wannabe famous people and brands with robust followings on Facebook.

Live videos will also get a new landing area on Facebook so people can find current and past live videos. Desktop users will be able to view a map of the world showing current live broadcasts. Facebook is also adding a number of new bells and whistles to make live videos more appealing for broadcasters and viewers. Users will be able to broadcast a video specifically to a Facebook group or event. Facebook imagines this being used for family gatherings or Q&A sessions.
