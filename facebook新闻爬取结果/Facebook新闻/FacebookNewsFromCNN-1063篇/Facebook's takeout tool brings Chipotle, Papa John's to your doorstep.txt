Facebook is continuing its efforts to make sure you stay on the platform for as long as possible.  It doesn't even want you to take a break to order dinner. That's why the social network announced on Friday a new tool that lets you order takeout directly from the site or mobile app.   Facebook has been testing its "Order Food" tool for the past year and is officially rolling it out to all users on Friday.  You'll be able to see restaurants nearby that are up for picking up your meals, including Delivery.com, DoorDash and ChowNow. Facebook is also partnering directly with restaurants like Papa John's, Panera, Jack in the Box, TGI Friday's, Denny's Chipotle and Five Guys, among others.

If the restaurant you're ordering from offers takeout or delivery with multiple services, you can select which one you'd like to use.  Previously, the company partnered with Open Table to offer restaurant reservation booking within the Facebook app.  It also launched a feature called Marketplace that lets users browse items for sale nearby, like furniture and clothing, and a travel-planning tool called City Guides that offers shopping, nightlife and restaurant recommendations.  Other big platforms are working to keep people engaged for longer. Earlier this week, Snapchat announced a new feature that lets users book Uber and Lyft rides and make restaurant reservations directly through the app.
