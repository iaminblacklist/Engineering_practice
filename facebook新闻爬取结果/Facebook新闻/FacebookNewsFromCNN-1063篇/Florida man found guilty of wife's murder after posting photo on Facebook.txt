A Florida man who posted a photograph of his wife's body on Facebook was found guilty Wednesday of second-degree murder. Derek Medina of South Miami was accused of shooting his wife, Jennifer Alonso, in August 2013. After he killed her, authorities say, he posted a picture of her body on his Facebook page with a note. Prosecutors are expected to seek a life sentence at a hearing set for January.  "No family should ever have to see their daughter killed and then exhibited world-wide on the internet like some macabre trophy to a husband's anger as was Jennifer Alfonso," Miami Dade State's Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said in a statement. "Far, far too often this kind of domestic violence leads to injury and death. That's why we all must end all forms of domestic violence," she said. The gruesome image stayed online and was passed around for at least five hours. Facebook was notified of the content and employees removed the picture and disabled Medina's page and that of his deceased wife, according to Facebook. In his note, Medina accused his wife of abusing him and asked his friends for their understanding for what he did to her because of it. "Im going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys miss you guys takecare Facebook people you will see me in the news," he purportedly wrote. After he killed his wife, authorities say, Medina drove to see his family and then turned himself in to police. After he gave police his address, they drove to the scene, where they found the body. The couple's young daughter was still in the house, police have said. She was not physically hurt.
