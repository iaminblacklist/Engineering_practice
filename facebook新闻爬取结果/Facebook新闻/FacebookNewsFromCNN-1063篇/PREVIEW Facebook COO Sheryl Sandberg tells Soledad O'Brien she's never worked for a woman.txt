Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is making waves with her position on women in the workplace. Her new book, "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead" is already #1 on Amazon.com's bestseller list.  Sandberg has been dealing with plenty of criticism for suggesting women are largely to blame for their failure to compete with men in corporate America. But she tells Soledad in her sitdown interview for "Starting Point" that men can help change that going forward.  "I’ve never worked for a woman," Sandberg tells Soledad. "I have been really lucky and I've had great mentors and great sponsors. And part of Lean In is trying to help people find the right way to develop those mentors and sponsors. And saying to every man out there, it should be a badge of honor to mentor young women. Not something you’re ashamed to do, not something you’re afraid someone will assume something bad, but a badge of honor that you are willing to spend you time giving benefit of your experience to young women in the workforce. They need it." You can watch much more of Soledad's interview with Sheryl Sandberg Monday, March 18th on Starting Point.
