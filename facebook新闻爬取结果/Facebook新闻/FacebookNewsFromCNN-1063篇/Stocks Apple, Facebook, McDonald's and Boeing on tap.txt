Corporate earnings from heavy hitters will drive markets this week, as will data on the housing market.  Eye on tech: Several major tech companies will report quarterly results, including Netflix, Apple, AT&T, Facebook, Amazon and Zynga.  The financial performance of these companies always garners a lot of attention. But investors are even more keenly awaiting them this time, because they come close on the heels of poor earnings reports from Google and Microsoft last week, which dragged the Nasdaq down 0.3%.

Boeing will also release results, and investors will be listening closely to executives for any additional explanations on the spate of incidents, including fire, on its marquee 787 Dreamliner aircraft.  Housing in play: The housing market will be in focus, as well, this week. The FHFA housing price index, new home sales,home sales and MBA mortgage index are on tap throughout the week.  Home sales, home prices and construction have been on the rise so far this year, helped by low mortgage rates and a drop in foreclosures. In the last 10 weeks, however, mortgage rates have been climbing steadily, raising the cost of buying a home for potential buyers, even though rates are still low by historical standards.
