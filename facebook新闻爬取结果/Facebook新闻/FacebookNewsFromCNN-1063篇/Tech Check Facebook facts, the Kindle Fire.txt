On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, John Sutter and Stephanie Goldberg break down the continuing interest (fervor? freak-out?) over Facebook's changes: both the ones that have already rolled out and the ones that are on the way. Apps that use "frictionless sharing" to publish your activities from across the web, the soon-to-be implemented Timeline and everybody's favorite, the real-time ticker have all got folks talking. We'll discuss the fact and fiction about them all. The team also breaks down Amazon's announcement of the Kindle Fire. The online retailer's entry into the tablet computer market marks the first time a major competitor has offered a tablet that undercuts the iPad by hundreds of dollars. Could the Fire put a dent in the iPad's dominance? Or is it too simplified to be a true alternative? Our Reader Comments of the Week come from our Netiquette writers' column on ways to avoid junking up your friends' email inboxes. And for the Tech Fail of the Week, we circle back to Facebook to take on that most insidious of viral, all-caps Status Update spam.  Is the site really going to start charging? (Spoiler alert: No).
