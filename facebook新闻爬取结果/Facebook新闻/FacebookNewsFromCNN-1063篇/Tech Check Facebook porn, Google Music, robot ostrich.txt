On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, John Sutter and Stephanie Goldberg break down the big news from Facebook. Namely, porn. A major spam attack on the site caused millions of users to see porn, extreme violence and other unsavory images this week. Facebook says that the attack spread when people were tricked into pasting malicious code into their outdated Web browsers. The site says it's now identified who was responsible, but not before lots of folks had their News Feeds rudely interrupted. Also this week, we discuss Google Music, the web giant's entry into the digital music world that was released to the public this week. Will the service just be a knock-off of what Apple and Amazon have been doing for years? Or will Google Music become a legitimate player in digital listening (not to mention a new tool in the Android vs. iPhone battle)? Our Reader  Comments of the Week come from John's story on an emerging technology we can all support-- a robot ostrich. The military's research arm is working on a robot called Fast Runner that, well, looks a lot like an ostrich. Our commenters had thoughts on this (including one that called for a stern rebuttal from Stephanie). And we return to Facebook for the Tech Fail of the Week. When not being beset by nasty images this week, Facebook was busy telling internationally known author Salman Rushdie that he's not Salman Rushdie.
