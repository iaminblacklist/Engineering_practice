On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, John Sutter and Stephanie Goldberg break down what Facebook's $5 billion initial public offering reveals about the site. The massive filing was obviously big news for potential investors. But for Facebook users, it offered some rare glimpses inside the mind of CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the inner workings (and private concerns) of the social-networking mega-site. For instance: What worries Facebook the most about the future? Two potential answers showed up in the filing. We also talk about the renewed focus on human-rights concerns arising from the factories that make gadgets for Apple and other hardware companies. Business Insider's Steve Kovach wrote a piece for us asking whether users should feel guilty about owning an iPhone considering the reports of poor working conditions, suicides and the like at Foxconn. We take a look and ask questions about what, if anything, Apple will do in response. Our Reader Comment of the Week comes from a story about the Facebook IPO. The reader's conclusion is either "possible," as John says, or "ridiculous," according to Doug. Listen as the fireworks commence. And our Tech Fail of the Week goes to the folks behind the golden arches. McDonald's, apparently not having ever looked at the internet, thought asking social-media users to share memories of the fast-food restaurant would result in a lot of nice comments. The result? They weren't lovin' it. To listen to Tech Check, click on the audio box to the left. To subscribe, you can add Tech Check to your RSS feed here.
