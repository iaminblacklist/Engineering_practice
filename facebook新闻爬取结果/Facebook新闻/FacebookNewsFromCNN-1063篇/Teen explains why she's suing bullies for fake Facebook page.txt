School yard bullies still exist, but here's a word that didn't even exist a decade ago: Cyberbullying.  And it may be even more dangerous.At least 6% of students report that they've experienced it. Unlike the old-fashioned kind of bullying, schools can't always intervene with legal action. That was the case for 14-year-old Georgia student Alex Boston. She was the victim of a fraudulent Facebook page set up by two classmates, who distorted her photo and made hurtful comments about other students in her name. The school said its hands were tied because the page was created off-campus. Now, Alex is taking matters into her own hands by suing the two bullies for libel. Alex, her parents Chris and Amy Boston, and their lawyer Natalie Woodward talk with Soledad about this on "Starting Point" and explain why they decided to seek legal action.
