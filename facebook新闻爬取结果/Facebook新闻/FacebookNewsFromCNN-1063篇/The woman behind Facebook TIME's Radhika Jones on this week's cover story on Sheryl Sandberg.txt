This week's TIME magazine cover story has the first interview with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on her new book "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead."  The big reveal? Sandberg is anything but bossy. Sandberg also talks to TIME about last week's firestorm involving Marissa Mayer, as well as the ongoing criticism of her advice for women in the workplace.  That’s just one of the insights into the woman behind who leads the world's largest social networking site. This morning on "Starting Point," TIME's Radhika Jones shares more from the interview.  Jones sheds light on the Sandberg’s inspirational professional persona and the field where she plays a pivotal role.  “She's incredibly intelligent and competent person who has risen to the top of the field where you don't see a lot of women, period,” Jones says. “Let alone leadership positions. But she is passionate about bringing other women up with her and about advising women who are at the beginnings of their careers to be ambitious, be active and stay in.”
