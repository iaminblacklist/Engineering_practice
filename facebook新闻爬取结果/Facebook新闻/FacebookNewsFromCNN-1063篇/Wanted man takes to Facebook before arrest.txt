A Colorado man wanted on suspicion of shooting and killing his mother posted farewell messages to Facebook Saturday -- just hours before authorities captured him.  Rayshawn Laster, 26, of Colorado Springs, is accused of shooting his mother in the head Friday night and then attempting to carjack a woman as he tried to flee the scene, said Lari Sevene, a spokeswoman for the El Paso County Sheriff's Office.  Laster appears to have begun posting messages to Facebook shortly after the shooting, Sevene said. He was arrested without incident Saturday morning. Over a period of four to five hours, messages on Laster's page vacillated between a sort of explanation and a series of farewells. CNN can not independently confirm the validity of the postings, though Sevene said authorities believe they are from Laster.  "Im sorry for nothing. My journey has come to an end," one message read.  In another, Laster wrote: "Alot of people will never understand. Why? Only a few kno the truth. Life goes on. Solid." The last entry, made shortly after midnight in Colorado, he appears to ask the mother of his two children to look after them.  "Ur gonna hate me for being selfish. I dont blame u. Be a good mom to our kids. Dont let them grow up to hate u chica. B tbere for them. No matter what u gotta do. They are all over. Everywhere around me so its only a mattet of time. I love u chica," he said.
