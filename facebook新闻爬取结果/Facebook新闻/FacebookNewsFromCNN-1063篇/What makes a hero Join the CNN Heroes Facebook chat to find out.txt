Have you ever wondered what it takes to be a hero? Join the CNN Heroes live Q&A happening right now on the CNN Heroes Facebook page. For the past 10 years, CNN has been honoring people who make extraordinary contributions to their communities, and improve the lives of others. You can ask three real-life heroes how they are protecting vulnerable children across the world, and what you can do to help an issue you care about. They are: Pushpa Basnet, 2012 CNN Hero of the Year who created the The Early Childhood Development Centre. Her mission is to give freedom to children of jailed mothers in Nepal, who are often locked up alongside them if they don't have another guardian. Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, a 2010 CNN Hero who has been delivering care packages to refugees since the 1990s. His charity, Mary's Meals, now feeds a million school children every day. Juan Pablo Romero Fuentes, a 2014 CNN Hero who turned his home into Los Patojos -- an after-school center for students struggling with drugs and gang warfare.
