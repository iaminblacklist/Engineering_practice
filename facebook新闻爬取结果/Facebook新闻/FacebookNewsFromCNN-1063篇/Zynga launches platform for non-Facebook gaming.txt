Zynga, maker of "FarmVille," is trying to diversify beyond its signature Facebook games.  Zynga.com will no longer be just its corporate website â€” it will also be a platform that features the company's most popular games as well as titles by other publishers. The site, which is set to go live in a few days, will feature "Words with Friends," "CastleVille," "Zynga Poker," "Hidden Chronicles" and "CityVille," the company announced on its blog Thursday. In addition, Zynga has partnered with MobScience, Row Sham Bow and Sava to develop games for the platform. The site will also include Social Stream, a feature which lets you play in real time with your friends and find new ones. Though it sounds like Zynga is trying to create its own social network, CEO Mark Pincus wrote in the blog entry that "we built Zynga.com to complement [Facebook's] pervasive social graph." Using Zynga.com, other publishers will be to "extend the reach of their games and connect to even more players," Pincus wrote on the blog. "Later this year we'll make our platform available for all social game developers through a Zynga API," he added. Though Zynga has an enviable relationship with Facebook and generates 12% of that company's revenues, Pincus' company is looking to diversify its sources of income. Currently, 93% of Zynga's revenues come from Facebook. Given the strong symbiotic relationship between the two, perhaps its no surprise that investors lauded the news; Thursday afternoon, Zynga's stock was up 6% following the announcement.
