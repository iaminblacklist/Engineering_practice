The U.S. House Intelligence Committee has disclosed several Facebook ads which it says Russian troll farms posted on the social media site in attempts to further increase the political divide among Americans during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. 
The ads seemingly targeted almost every segment of the population from Bernie Sanders supporters to Black Lives Matter proponents to NRA members. Of course, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump supporters were also among those targeted.

Perhaps just as importantly, the committee also released the metadata alongside the ads. This allows people to see who the ads were targeting as well as how many people could have seen each ad and how many times the ads were clicked upon. 
Facebook users were served about 80,000 posts, Instagram users about 120,000 posts and there were 3,000 ads that Facebook has traced to alleged Russian operatives.
