A 25-year-old man being chased by police went on Facebook Live during part of the nearly three-hour-long incident. 
In the video, Brenton Hager wears his seatbelt, honks at other drivers, sends messages to his friends about needing a lawyer, asks someone to call his mom, contemplates the charges he'll face, and tells various people he loves them. 
"Hey, wanna see me in a high-speed chase?" he yells to someone outside the vehicle at one point. "I'm in a high-speed chase, bro!"

From WSPA.com, a CBS station : Police threw stop sticks in front of the truck several times, but the driver always managed to get around them. And several times, officers had their guns trained on the suspect but didn't shoot. He stopped at one point to pull the tool box out of the back of the truck. That's when someone with a gun shot out his back tire. The chase ended when Hager drove into a field and then a pond. Police used a stun gun on him and took him into custody. 
KOKO News 5 in Oklahoma said his mother was relieved he wasn't killed in the chase. View Comments
