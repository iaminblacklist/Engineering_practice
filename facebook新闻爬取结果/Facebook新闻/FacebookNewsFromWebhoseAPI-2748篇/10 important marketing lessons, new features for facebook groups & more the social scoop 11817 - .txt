This Week‚Äôs Top 3 Articles 1. 10 Things We Learned About Marketing This Year via BrandWatch.com My good friend Steve Rayson from BuzzSumo (recently acquired by BrandWatch) is a total ninja when it comes to research and analyzing the data for key takeaways. I love the studies in this super-informative article. For example, #2 ‚Äì bloggers are spending more time on content production and producing less content. What does that mean? Move over short-form blogging, long-form is in! Indeed, this is what I did on my latest blog post about Facebook‚Äôs News Feed changes and tests ‚Äì over 4,000 words. (Oh, and #4 on Steve‚Äôs list gets me most excited, hehee!) 2. New Features for Facebook Groups to Build Communities via Facebook.com In June of this year Facebook announced a new mission: ‚ÄúGive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.‚Äù An important part of this initiative was to support group admins by giving them tools to grow, improve, and manage their groups.
