2 senators just trolled Facebook Posted on Mashable 
Russia's not the only country who knows how to troll. 
Two Democratic senators created a Facebook page for a fake political group, just to prove that they could. 
Ads for the page — created by Mark Warner of Virginia and Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar — were able to reach 1,407 Washington D.C.-based journalists, and 1,369 other Capitol Hill staffers. They only paid $20. 
Yes. That's how easy it is to spread fake news.
