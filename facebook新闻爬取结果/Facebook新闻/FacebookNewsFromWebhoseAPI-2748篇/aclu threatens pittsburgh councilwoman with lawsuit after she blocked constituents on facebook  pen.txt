The Pennsylvania American Civil Liberties Union is threatening a Pittsburgh city councilwoman with a lawsuit after she blocked constituents on her official city Facebook page. 
TribLive.com reports that Councilwoman Darlene Harris blocked three North Side residents in October after they posted comments about her driving a vehicle along an access road in Allegheny Commons Park, according to a letter ACLU Legal Director Vic Walczak wrote to Harris. 
Harris also blocked a fourth resident after who said Harris was "uninterested in development or change," according to the report. 
Walczak asked Harris in the letter written Tuesday to unblock the residents by Dec. 4. 
"If we do not receive a response and our clients remain blocked from your Facebook page by the deadline, we will interpret your silence as a rejection of this request and will take appropriate steps to protect our clients' constitutional rights," he wrote. 
One of those steps, according to TribLive.com, includes a lawsuit. 
Harris did not provide a comment for the story. View Comments
