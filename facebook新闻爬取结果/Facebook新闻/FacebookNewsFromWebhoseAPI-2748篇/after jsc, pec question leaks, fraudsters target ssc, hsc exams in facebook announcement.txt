After JSC, PEC question leaks, fraudsters target SSC, HSC exams in Facebook announcement Sajia Afrin, bdnews24.com Previous Next After making available the leaked question paper during the last PEC test, a Facebook page says its next mission is to upload leaked questions of SSC and HSC examinations on the internet. 
Around 50 minutes before the PEC math test started at 11am on Sunday, the page -- All Exam Suggestion Roki Vai – posted a photo of the leaked question paper. 
Handwritten answers were also uploaded in the post --‘psc math final question 2017’. The question paper fully matched with the original one used in the Dhaka board exam.
Before PEC, question papers of JSC exams had also been leaked. The 'leakers' charged some money during the first few JSC exams but later uploaded the papers for free. 
Several quarters, including teachers, students and parents, are frustrated at the malpractice, but the authorities said they tried but could not stop it. 
‘All Exam Suggestion Roki Vai’ page claimed it had successfully uploaded question papers of JSC exams. 
A few hours after the PEC exam ended on Sunday, the page allured the students with a promise to leak question papers of SSC and HSC exams. “Attention plzzz. Next mission. SSC+HSC,” was how the post started.
It asked the students of only Dhaka board to contact on Facebook Messenger to get the leaked question papers. 
“Terms and conditions apply,” it added. 
It admitted that it could not provide many PEC candidates with leaked question papers because the exams were held with ‘district-wise questions’. 
“But we’ve provided 100% common questions in JSC, and will do the same in SSC and HSC,” the page said in the post. 
It urged the users to hit the Like and Share buttons more to let others know about their announcement. Advertisement
