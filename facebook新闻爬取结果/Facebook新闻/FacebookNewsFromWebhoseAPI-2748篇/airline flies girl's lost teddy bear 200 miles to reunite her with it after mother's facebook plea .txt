Miss Walter said: “It’s always a shame to see a little girl who has lost her best friend, especially when travelling through Scotland’s biggest airport and there was a real risk it might be gone forever. 
“As soon as I spotted the plea on social media I thought it would be easy for the airline to try and help. It was a heart-warming moment to be there for Summer and Teddy’s reunion 
“It definitely brought a little tear to my eye and was a lovely way to end the week. It’s up there with one of the more memorable flights I’ve been on and shows the airline’s commitment to the communities we serve.”
