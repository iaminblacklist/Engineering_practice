Alert! Password Stealing Hack Hitting Facebook Users Right Now By Reprint 
Cybercriminals are coming up with more sophisticated attacks all the time. The more elaborate the scheme, the better chance they have at finding new, unsuspecting victims. 
That’s why you need to stay informed of the latest scams so you know what to watch out for. There’s an extremely sneaky one targeting Facebook users now that is putting your passwords at risk. 
What this hack looks like 
We’re talking about a phishing attack that is spreading via Facebook Messenger. The cybercriminals behind the attack are using a redirection technique that leads to a spoofed Facebook login page. If you end up on the spoofed page, you could wind up handing your password over to the criminal. 
You really need to be careful with this scam, it’s spreading like wildfire. There have already been over 200,000 victims in only a few days. 
Here’s how the scam works. 
Victims are receiving malicious messages through Facebook Messenger with links that appear to lead to a YouTube video. Hovering over the link won’t even give away that it’s going to a spoofed site. 
That’s because the hackers are using URL shorteners like utm.io and po.st. Those disguise the actual destination by including YouTube in the URL. It’s easy for a user to think the link will lead them to YouTube, but it won’t!
