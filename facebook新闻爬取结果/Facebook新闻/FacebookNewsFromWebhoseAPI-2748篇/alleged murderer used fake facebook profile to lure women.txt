Once the victims arrived in Qumbu, the suspect, acting through the fake Facebook profile, would tell the women that he was occupied and would send somebody else to fetch them. 
However, the suspect would arrive, pretending to be someone else, and take the victims to the Ngcalukeni fields where he’d rape and kill them. 
Fatyela said the victims were strangled with fishing rope and stripped of their clothes. 
The suspects are expected to appear in the Mthatha Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
