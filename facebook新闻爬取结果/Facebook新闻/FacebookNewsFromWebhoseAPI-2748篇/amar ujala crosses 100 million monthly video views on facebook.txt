Home Featured Amar Ujala Crosses 100 Million Monthly Video Views on Facebook Amar Ujala Crosses 100 Million Monthly Video Views on Facebook Posted By: tvnews4u on: Print Email Noida: Amar Ujala has crossed the 100 Million Video views a month mark on Facebook (source, Facebook Insights), signaling its rapidly increasing popularity among video viewers on social media. Anticipating the shifting priorities and tastes of the fickle digital user, Amar Ujala has stayed ahead of the curve with the launch of India’s first interactive fully digital TV – Amar Ujala TV. 
Evidently, this is paying rich dividends, both on Amar Ujala TV and amarujala.com where they are clocking 50 million users a month (source: Google Analytics, August 2017), and on Amar Ujala’s Facebook page, where they’ve already crossed 6 million followers. 
Among Amar Ujala’s most popular video programmes, are UP News, News Hour and Jan kiBaat, keenly followed and viewed live by lakhs of viewers from India (Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi NCR, Bihar, Rajasthan, Mumbai) and abroad (US, UK, Gulf). 
While there is no dearth of videos on Facebook and outside it, there are very few credible content brands providing original content from the cities and towns of the Indo-Gangetic plains. It is this gap that Amar Ujala seems to have filled – bringing live news roundups, rare interviews and incredible feature pieces from the Hindi heartland. 
In a growth curve of the internet, when ‘fake news’ has become a buzzword, Amar Ujala is reaping the benefit of its focus on videos, staying-close-to-the-ground and the solidity of credible news and features.
