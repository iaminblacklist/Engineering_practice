Please check even though Singapore passport is most powerful in the world. Implications of ban 
However, a check on Yeeâ€™s two Facebook pages showed that the offending post appeared to have been removed only from his personal page but not his public profile page, which has more than 45,000 followers. 
The post was still visible on Nov. 12 at 5am on his public figure page. 
It is unclear if a temporary ban will stop Yee from accessing and posting on both his personal and public page, or only on his personal page, which Facebook acted against. 
His last posts from both of his pages were dated Nov. 7, the day his offending post was taken down. New YouTube videos 
In the last 10 days, Yee has put up four new videos on his YouTube platform. They revolve around recounting his time spent in jail and responding to his critics. 
This was following his 10-month absence from the online space due to his detention in jail in the United States as he waited to win his asylum bid and to be released. 
In one of the four latest videos, Yee also revealed that his original Twitter account had been suspended and he is appealing for it to be reinstated. 
He did not explain why he lost control of that account but said he has set up a new one in the meantime. Share this story: If you like what you read, follow us on Facebook and Twitter to get the latest updates. About Belmont Lay
