ANOTHER STUNNING LIBERAL LIE EXPOSED: Facebook Says Russian Ads Comprised Only .004% of Newsfeed During Election November 1, 2017 by Jim Hoft Total: 1.2K Email Well, there goes another Democrat Party #FakeNews narrative. 
Democrats and their #FakeNews media claimed Russia ads on Facebook flipped the election away from Hillary to Trump. Today the House Intelligence Committee released several Facebook ads and posts linked to a Russian troll operation during and after the 2016 presidential election. 
Half of them were pro-Hillary. 
And then thereâ€™s thisâ€¦ Facebook executive Colin Stretch told the US Senate Judiciary Committee that the total number of those illegitimate ads are a drop in the ocean â€” less than 0.004 percent of all content â€” or about 1 in 23,000 news feed items. 
There goes that narrative.
