An artist "couldn't stop laughing" after Facebook banned her Christmas cards for being "too sexual". 
Jackie Charley tried to upload images of her collection of festive cards to the social media site several times without success. 
On each occasion she received the same error message which read: "It looks like we didn't approve your item because we don't allow the sale of adult items or services (e.g. sexual enhancement items or adult videos)." 
The cards included a brightly-coloured robin redbreast, a stag and a squirrel. 
Taking to her Facebook group Jackie Charley said: "Hilariously, Facebook has blocked my Christmas cards from becoming a product in my shop due to their shameful, sexual nature!" Read More Runaway bull which forced school into lockdown during five-hour rampage is shot dead by police 
People have taken to Facebook to express their views on the art. 
Mark Fassler said: "Wow, you have a dirty mind! (I am going to save these for my private porn stash, however...) 
While Sandra Porter added: "Perhaps they think the robin should be wearing trousers to protect his modesty lol." Jackie Charley (Image: Jackie Charley Art / Facebook) Read More
