Artist’s 'sexual' robin redbreast Christmas cards banned by Facebook Jackie Charley said she ‘could not stop laughing’ after harmless festive images were blocked by Facebook because of ‘adult’ natureFacebook has blocked the sale of a pack of Christmas cards featuring a robin redbreast because of its “sexual” and “adult” nature. But Facebook blocked what it perceived as an “adult item” after the artist attempted to upload the image to her Bothycrafts page. In a post on her Facebook page, Charley said she was sent the message: “It looks like we didn’t approve your item because we don’t allow the sale of adult items or services (e.g. sexual enhancement items or adult videos).”The 52-year-old wrote: “Hilariously, Facebook has blocked my Christmas cards from becoming a product in my shop due to their shameful, sexual nature! For instance, the robin card was simply called ‘Robin’, not ‘Robin Redbreast’ as some people have wondered.
