A Hindu village in Bangladesh was burnt down after a rumour spread that a local youth had insulted the Prophet Mohammed in a Facebook post. 
More than 30 houses were set alight in the Rangpur Sadar upazila (district) following the man’s alleged defamation of the religious figure on social media. 
The mob reportedly emerged from a crowd of 20,000 people who had gathered from six or seven neighbouring Muslim villages. Anger started to grow after a local Muslim businessman lodged a complaint with the police about the alleged Facebook post. Burma attacks UN for meddling in Bangladesh Rohingya refugee talks 
One person was killed and five others received serious injuries as the police tried to stop the arson and looting attack in the village of Thakurpara, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune , by firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd. 
In response to the police violence, the group blocked the local Rangpur-Dinajpur highway in protest, blocking traffic for about four hours.
