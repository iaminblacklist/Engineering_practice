MORE A hunter had just killed a buck Nov. 16 in Alcona County when a bear arrived and dragged it away.
"No no no – go on, git. My deer. Go on," John Wardynski said to the bear in a video (see below) he posted on Facebook. The bear ignored him. "I don’t know what to do now. I can't shoot the bear but he's gonna … eat my deer ... I never had this before."
The video posted Nov. 18 shows the bear walking through the woods to the deer and rolling it over, and Wardynski said it later dragged the six-point buck away. He explained what happened in his Facebook post:
"I walked down my shooting lane to check the spot where I shot my buck. Turning to see the line of site of my shot, there was a bear standing next to my pop up blind. The bear came down the ridge, then proceeded to parallel me as I walked my blood trail. Thought it was pretty cool to see a bear that close, so I started videoing with my iPhone."
As he realized the bear was heading for his deer, he began "shouting, whistling, breaking brush. She would not leave." He even tried firing his 9mm – away from the bear – a couple times but said it started coming toward him, he said in the comments.
And this is a familiar bear to Wardynski: "It's a sow. Have trailcam pics of her & her cubs. The biologist said the berry crop failed & the oak mast is at 3 year low. She's hungry."
Post by john.wardynski . By Wednesday morning, the video had accrued more than 100,000 views. Wardynski said in the post he's been hunting for more than 50 years but had never seen something like this. He said he hoped he'd at least be able to recover the antlers.
