Brett Ratner Sues Woman for Libel Over Rape Accusation Made on Facebook thewrap.com – Director Brett Ratner has filed a libel lawsuit in Hawaii against a woman who, in an October 20 Facebook post, accused him of raping her. In the post, Melanie Kohler said Ratner “was a rapist on at least one night in Hollywood about 12 years ago,” and that he “preyed on me as a drunk girl [and] forced himself upon me,” according to quoted excerpts in the lawsuit, a copy of which was obtained by TheWrap. Filed in Hawaii federal court via Ratner’s attorney, Eric Seitz, the suit “contends that the Defendant’s aforementioned statement is entirely false, fabricated and fictional.” The lawsuit also asserts that Kohler’s statement was published “with knowledge of its falsity, maliciously, and with the intent to harm plaintiff’s reputation and standing.” Also Read:
