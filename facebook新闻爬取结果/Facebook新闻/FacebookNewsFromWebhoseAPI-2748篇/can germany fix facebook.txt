In early October, a musical titled Facebook—Terms and Conditions toured in Germany. It’s an intentionally outlandish love story about an aspiring novelist who pens a fictional work about an imaginary social network. The novel just happens to be titled Facebook—Terms and Conditions . Then, as luck would have it, she meets the founder of a new social-media network in search of a “complicated user’s manual” for his creation. In a masterstroke of farcical proportions, her novel becomes the terms and conditions of use for his social network.
The show’s creators, the satirist Peer Gahmert and the choreographer Tim Gerhards, usually collaborate on more-traditional theater projects “that no one visits and which no one wants to see,” as Gahmert put it in a recent interview. This time, their goal was to satirize Facebook’s cryptic regulations, which have made the company a target of vehement public criticism in a society historically suspicious of censorship in all forms. Virtually the entire script—including its eight musical numbers—is made up of phrases drawn from Facebook’s fine print. It also quotes from portions of the company’s community standards , which broadly outline what kinds of content are and are not allowed on the site (including direct threats, bullying, hate speech, violence, and attacks on public figures), as well as the company’s opaque procedures for removing posts that violate those standards.
