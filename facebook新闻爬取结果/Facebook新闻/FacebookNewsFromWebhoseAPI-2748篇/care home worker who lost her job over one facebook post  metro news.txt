A care home worker who lost her job due to a Facebook post has taken legal action against the council that sacked her. 
Rachel Burns worked at Park Hall caring for elderly and vulnerable residents in Reigate, Surrey, for 21 years. TfL plans to axe 1,400 jobs in engineering and on London Underground 
Her career was brought to an abrupt end in 2015 when she posted images and a video of people in her care dancing and singing at a care home event. 
Within two months, Surrey County Council dismissed Ms Burns on the basis her behaviour breached the care home’s social media policy. 
In the offending post, taken during a party at Park Hall, Ms Burns wrote, ‘you all made it a fab night, proud to be your manager’. The offending Facebook post (Picture: SWNS) 
Ms Burns was hauled into a meeting and given an ultimatum, a demotion with 50% pay cut or dismissal. Upskirting is still not illegal, and this woman is running out of patience 
In August this year, a tribunal upheld her claim for unfair dismissal. 
She said: ‘Justice has prevailed. It’s amazing that if you believe in something and you know your worth you just keep going.’ 
Ms Burns is now waiting to find out how much compensation she will receive. 
The decision is expected on November 13, though Ms Burns worries the sum will be low as her record shows dismissal for serious misconduct. Ms Burns sued for unfair dismissal (Picture: SWNS)
