Facebook wants to make it a little more convenient for you to connect with brands online to get questions answered and customer service issues sorted out.
A beta Customer Chat plugin will allow businesses to bring the capabilities of Messenger into their websites. As a customer, this means you'll be able to chat with businesses on their own websites via Messenger (on the web and in the mobile app), and transition back and forth without losing the conversation history.
"This makes it easier for customers to continue the conversation with a business whenever and wherever it's most convenient for them," the Facebook Messenger team wrote in a blog post .
