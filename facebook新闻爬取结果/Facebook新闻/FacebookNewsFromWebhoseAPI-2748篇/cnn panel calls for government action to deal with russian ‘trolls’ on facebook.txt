Several CNN commentators argued for stricter regulation of speech on the Internet during a segment Monday night in which they discussed Russian activity online. 
Former deputy director of the CIA’s counterterrorist center and the FBI’s national security branch Philip Mudd advocated for real-time countermeasures against Russian content on Facebook. He was responding to a new report that Facebook executives believe as many as 126 million people saw content generated by Russian “troll farms” on the social media site. 
“I can’t overestimate the significance of this,” Mudd said. “What’s happening now in terms of these revelations about Facebook has to twist government on its head.” 
He said U.S. intelligence agencies would have to coordinate with Facebook directly to deal with this threat and “take this stuff off the Internet.” This article was posted: Tuesday, October 31, 2017 at 7:58 am Share this article
