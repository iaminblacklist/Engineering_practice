Coleen Rooney enjoyed a girly night out in Manchester just hours after baring her soul on Facebook over her marriage. 
The mother-of-three - who is expecting her fourth child with former Manchester United striker Wayne - was pictured with pals at a city centre restaurant. 
Coleen, 31, joined a host of other WAGs and friends at the Julie Perry Events annual fashion show, with Philip Armstrong catwalk, at Artisan in Spinningfields. 
Tanya Bardsley, Jude Cisse and the wives and partners of a number of Manchester United footballers were also present.

In it she said she wasn’t taking the former Manchester United player back ‘as he’s never left’ - and revealed her wedding ring is back on. 
The couple’s relationship has been rumoured to be on the rocks since Wayne was caught drink driving another woman’s car after a boozy night out in Alderley Edge. 
His meeting with Laura Simpson landed the footballer in hot water - and all over the tabloids. 
But Coleen said in her post: “It’s my decision .... do I love Wayne ... yes I do. If I didn’t then I wouldn’t be trying to make it work. I know I would be fine on my own, with just me and my children, but I don’t want to live like that, I want to try and continue our marriage and live as a family, because that’s what I want to do.” Like us on Facebook
