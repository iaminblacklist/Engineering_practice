Coons: “Why has it taken Facebook 11 months?" Wednesday Nov 1, 2017 at 1:00 PM Sen. Coons: “If I understand your testimony here today, it's that 80,000 posts by the Russian-linked Internet Research Agency were seen by 29 million Americans and may have reached an estimated 126 million people.” 
“This ad was run on Facebook in May of 2016 - a key moment in the primary campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, when both were closing in on the nomination,” said Coons. “A group that claimed to be 'Heart of Texas,' but was in fact paid for by Russians in rubles used this ad to target Americans based on their professed characteristics like an interest in patriotism or supporting veterans. 
"The ad claims that Hillary Clinton is ‘only one politician except Barack Obama who is despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans.’ And, it says if Clinton were elected president, the ‘army should be withdrawn from her control according to amendments to the Constitution.’"This ad is nothing short of the Russian government directly interfering in our elections, lying to American citizens, duping folks who believe they are joining and supporting a group that is about veterans and based in Texas, when in fact it's paid for in Rubles by Russians. Should Facebook be allowed to be a platform that foreign adversaries can use to run political ads?”
