While other members of the House of Representatives were observing a moment of silence to honor victims of the church shooting in Texas, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) had other ideas.
Lieu walked out during the moment of silence to record a video for Facebook that apparently could not wait until the time of remembrance of those killed was over.
Why did he walk out? 
Lieu stepped out into the hallway to record an approximately one-minute video calling for gun legislation. Here’s what he said:
“My colleagues right now are doing a moment of silence in the House of Representatives’ chambers. I respect their right to do that and I myself have participated in many of them.”
“But I can’t do this again, I’ve been to too many moments of silences. In just my short period in Congress three of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history have occurred. I will not be silent.”
“What we need is action. We need to pass gun safety legislation now. Behind me is the House of Representatives chamber. I urge us to pass reasonable gun safety legislation, including a universal background check law, supported by 80 percent of Americans, a ban on assault rifles, and a ban on bump stocks. We need to do that. We cannot be silent. We need to act now.”
Debate reignited 
As always happens in the days following mass shootings, the gun control debate between Republicans and Democrats reached a fever pitch.
The primary issue from the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas was the legality of bump stock devices like the one the gunman used.
Lawmakers still haven’t come to any resolution on that, but the Senate Judiciary Committee will soon hold a hearing about bump stocks.
