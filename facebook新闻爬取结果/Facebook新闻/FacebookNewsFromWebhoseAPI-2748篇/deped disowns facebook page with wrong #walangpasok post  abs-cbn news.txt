MANILA - The Department of Education said Tuesday it was not the administrator of the Facebook page "Walang Pasok Advisory" where an erroneous announcement on class suspension was posted recently.
The department said it did not announce a suspension of classes on Nov. 23, 24 and 27, contrary to the post, which appeared to have been taken down.
"DepEd encourages the public to be more vigilant against fake news and half-truths, and be more discerning of information that they accept and disseminate," the department said.
Walang Pasok Advisory, which has 261,000 followers, also recently used ABS-CBN News' photo and logos without permission.
 The public can get get verified announcements on class suspension from DepEd's website, news.abs-cbn.com, or the verified pages ANC 24/7 , DZMM TeleRadyo , TV Patrol , and Patrol.PH .
