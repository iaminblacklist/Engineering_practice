Denise Keniston takes a selfie with Furniture Today's David Perry NAPLES, Fla. – Digital marketing expert Denise Keniston says retailers should be advertising on Facebook. 
Keniston, CEO and president of Web4Retail, a full-service advertising agency that works primarily in the furniture, bedding, appliance and interior design industries, gave attendees at Therapedic ’s annual meeting here a lesson in how to effectively utilize social media. Surveying the social media landscape, Keniston said Facebook is the obvious choice these days. “Facebook ads are the place to be,” she said.
But she also noted that LinkedIn and YouTube will gain ground next year because “Facebook will fade a bit as people look for the next new thing.” 
Keniston said many retailers don’t realize how valuable their digital real estate is, and are surprisingly open, at this point, to giving manufacturers access to those digital pages, if the manufacturers have a clear plan for using those assets.
