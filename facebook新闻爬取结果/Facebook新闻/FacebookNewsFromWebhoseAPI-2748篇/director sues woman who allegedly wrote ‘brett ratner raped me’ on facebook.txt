Embattled movie mogul Brett Ratner , a Miami Beach native, is suing a woman who claims the director raped her in L.A. over a decade ago, TMZ reports. 
According to the lawsuit, Melanie Kohler claimed in a since-deleted Oct. 20 Facebook post, “Brett Ratner raped me.” 
She is not one of the six women featured in a lengthy expose about Ratner published in The Los Angeles Times Wednesday detailing tales of sexual abuse that go years back. 
According to documents obtained by TMZ, Kohler claims the Miami Beach High grad “preyed on me as a drunk girl [and] forced himself upon me.” 
Ratner’s lawyer Marty Singer tells the gossip website that Kohler said she had met the director at an L.A. club in either 2004 or 2005. They then proceeded to his pal Robert Evans’ house, where Ratner was staying at and where she said the “Rush Hour” director forced her to have sex. 
Ratner is suing Kohler for defamation, claiming unspecified damages and that the post caused Ratner “emotional distress, worry, anger, and anxiety,” Variety reports . The article adds that in the post, she wrote that Ratner is not a “public monster” but that he should be held “accountable for the way he’s treated the nobodies of the world or at least the way he treated me.” 
Kohler, a former employee of the Endeavor Talent Agency, lives in Hawaii, where she and her husband operate a scuba school, the entertainment website adds. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more.
