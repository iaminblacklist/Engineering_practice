Dwyane Wade is the latest athlete to have a show on Facebook Mallory Locklear Tweet Share Facebook's next pro athlete-centered show will feature the Cleveland Cavaliers' Dwyane Wade. The five-part series will premiere on November 20th and will show what keeps Wade busy when he's off the court. BackCourt Wade follows the three-time NBA champion as he attends Paris and Milan fashion weeks, tries to learn golf and manages his businesses. Facebook already has a show featuring LA Laker Lonzo Ball, his father LaVar and his two brothers -- a series called Ball in the Family that was recently renewed for a second season. It also has a eight-part reality series starring Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch , and all of these shows complement the platform's growing slate of sports coverage . Each episode of BackCourt Wade will air on consecutive Mondays beginning next week. You can take a peek at the show in the trailer below.
