New Mexico, and particularly Los Lunas, got some great news this week with Facebook’s announcement it will construct four more buildings at its sprawling data center west of Los Lunas, which already has a 510,000-square-foot building under construction and a 460,000-square-foot building waiting in the wings. At build-out, the $1 billion, 330-acre campus’ six buildings will cover nearly 2.8 million square feet.
Each of the six buildings will employ 50 people in permanent positions, but the construction jobs will be a boon to the area for at least six more years. Company officials say there will be up to 1,000 construction workers on site. Two months ago, 650 were on site daily.
And the impact is already being felt. Earlier this month Los Lunas village administrator Greg Martins said gross receipts tax revenues are running about $2 million ahead of last fiscal year.
Yes, Facebook received numerous incentives to move to Los Lunas. But early tax revenues are very, very encouraging. And Facebook’s continued investment here shows there’s an awful lot to like about NM – something we hope Amazon considers as it decides where to locate its HQ2 .
