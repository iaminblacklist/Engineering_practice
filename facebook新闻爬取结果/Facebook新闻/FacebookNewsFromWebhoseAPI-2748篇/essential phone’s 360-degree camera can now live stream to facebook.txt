Then you select which folks can see your Facebook Live video, and if you want you can write up a description for the video as well.

In a blog post, Essential says that it will soon add support for live streaming 360-degree videos on Twitter, via Periscope. You can post 360-degree videos already on YouTube, but there no word on live streaming for that platform yet. This update comes even as the Essential Phone has seen a big price drop just a couple of months after it launched. Both Best Buy and Amazon are currently selling the phone by itself for $449.99, or you can pay just $50 more for the 360-degree camera.
