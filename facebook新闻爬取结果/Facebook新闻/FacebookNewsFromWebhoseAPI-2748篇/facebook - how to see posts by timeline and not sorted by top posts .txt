6,182 Facebook - How to see posts by timeline and not sorted by "top posts" ? I don't really take Facebook to seriously so this top posts bullsh#t was just a confusing irritation, your homepage has no rhyme or reason, "top posts" + ads what a mess.. those bloody useless mutha fuga's at Facebook. I'm pretty sure the only reason why they implement this rubbish "feature" is so they have an excuse to manipulate your timeline, ie insert which ever post or "sponsored" pseudo ad post they want, nevermind keeping the viewer confused and dumbed down. rant over. But now I have discovered Facebook classifieds groups and this top posts garbage makes trying to sort out what is new or not neigh impossible, a post 2hrs old will come right after a post a week old. Is there any way natively to view posts in a group by timeline on Facebook and if that isn't possible is there a hack or browser add-on or even android app that can do it?
