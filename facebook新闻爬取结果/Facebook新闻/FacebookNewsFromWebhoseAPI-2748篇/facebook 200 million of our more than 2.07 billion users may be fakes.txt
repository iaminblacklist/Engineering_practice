Facebook: 200 Million of Our More than 2.07 Billion Users May Be Fakes 
Despite months of talk about the problem of fraud, Facebook remains deeply infected by obvious counterfeits . Jonathan L. Zittrain, who studies the internet and society at Harvard, said these companies are reluctant to aggressively purge bogus users and deceptive content because of their business model, which is built on signing up more and more people. 
With 2.3 billion users worldwide, Facebook relies on complaints to police its content. So, Mr. Elwood used Facebookâ€™s internal complaint tool to report the Keven Eversley profile and 27 others showing evidence of deception. In all but a couple of cases, Facebook responded with a standard message of thanks for the feedback but said the profiles did not violate its community standards -- even though those standards require users to give their "authentic identities."
