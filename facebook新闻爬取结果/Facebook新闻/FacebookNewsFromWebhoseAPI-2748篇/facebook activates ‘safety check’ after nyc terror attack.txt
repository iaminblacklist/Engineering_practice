Facebook activated its “Safety Check” feature Tuesday after a gun-wielding motorist mowed down unsuspecting cyclists in a Lower Manhattan bike lane, killing at least eight people. 
At least 15 more were injured by the driver, who yelled, “Allahu Akbar!” — Arabic for “God is great!” — as he left the bodies in his wake, according to witnesses. 
“Police continue to investigate a shooting and vehicle ramming incident that occurred in the general area of Chambers St. and West St,” the social media site’s “Crisis Response” page for “The Violent Incident in Manhattan, New York,” read Tuesday. 
Facebook’s report came from NC4, an independent global crisis reporting agency. Facebook has enabled it's Safety Check on October 31, 2017 for the truck incident in Manhattan, New York. (Facebook) 
“Updated reports indicate that approximately six people have died, and as many as 15 people were injured in the incident,” the page read. 
It also alerted users to schools in the area being on precautionary lockdown in the wake of the violent incident. 
Local Facebook users flocked to the page, both to mark themselves safe and volunteer their services to victims, or those affected by the attack. 
By late afternoon, more than 240 Facebook members had offered to help those in need, by marking their own locations, and indicating how they could help.
