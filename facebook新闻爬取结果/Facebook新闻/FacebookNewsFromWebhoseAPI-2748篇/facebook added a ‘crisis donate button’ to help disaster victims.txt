From natural disasters to terror events, Facebook has been continuously expanding the capabilities of its Crisis Response Hub, which they rolled out in September of 2017 . 
Now, in addition to following the latest news or checking the status of friends in at-risk areas, Facebook has provided its users with another way to give back. On Friday, the social network unveiled the “crisis donate button,” which enables people to easily give money to organizations assisting victims.
