Facebook has decided GIFs are the way forward for poll posts on the social network, and has added support for the animated images to its mobile and web-based poll feature. Not only can GIFs be used for the poll itself, but also in responses. 
The poll feature is found inside the standard Whats On Your Mind section on the homepage. Tapping the menu expander button reveals various choices, with the final one being the poll. Facebook gives two polling options, with the chance to add either photos or GIFs. Answers, and who posted them, can be seen by the original poster. 
The GIF support comes soon after Facebook added special sticker-based polls to Instagram Stories, showing itâ€™s keen to push more visually interesting options to make the basic feature more interesting. Polls can also be posted to Twitter, which then run for a set amount of time, and have the option of adding four different choices for people to select. Get App Industry Updates
