Since the outbreak of its fake news crisis last year, Facebook has announced several initiatives designed to promote authentic, fact-based journalism. Today, the company is rolling out its latest: what Facebook calls a “trust indicator,” an icon that you can tap to learn more about the publisher of articles shared on Facebook.
Trust indicators , which you will see attach to articles shared on Facebook, offer information about publishers including their policies on ethics, fact-checking, and corrections, as well as their ownership structure and their masthead. Facebook said it will begin with a small group of publishers and expand over time.
“We believe that helping people access this important contextual information can help them evaluate if articles are from a publisher they trust, and if the story itself is credible,” Facebook said in a statement. “This step is part of our larger efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook — providing people with more context to help them make more informed decisions , advance news literacy and education, and working to reinforce indicators of publisher integrity on our platform.”
The introduction of trust indicators follows a move last month to introduce other contextual information into shared articles, including a basic description of the publisher, and other articles about the subject. The indicators were developed by the Trust Project , an international consortium of news organizations hosted by Santa Clara University. The organization’s funders include Google and Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist.
