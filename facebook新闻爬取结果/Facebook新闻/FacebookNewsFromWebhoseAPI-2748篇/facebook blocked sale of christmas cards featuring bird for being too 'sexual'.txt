Transcript: Facebook Blocked Sale of Christmas Cards Featuring Bird for Being Too 'Sexual' 
Russian trolls may have posted fake news all over Facebook with little to no consequence… But the social media giant’s gotta draw the line somewhere, and apparently that line is sexy bird pics. 
A UK artist named Jackie Charley revealed Facebook barred her from selling some Christmas cards, including one bearing a robin redbreast. 
Why? 
Because they were just too racy. 
Charley posted photos of the cards — which also include a squirrel and a stag, joking: “Hilariously, Facebook has blocked my Christmas cards from becoming a product in my shop due to their shameful, sexual nature!” She goes on to apparently quote Facebook’s message, which reads: "It looks like we didn't approve your item because we don't allow the sale of adult items or services (e.g. sexual enhancement items or adult videos).” Saying she “can’t stop laughing,” Charley suggests people judge the cards -- which are selling for around six pounds -- for themselves. 
However, according to USA Today, Facebook has since recognized the error, saying it “approved Jackie’s post as soon” as it became aware of the mistake. 
Cool… now about those trolls… You Might Like
