Facebook ( FB ) is set to report Q3 results this Wednesday, after the closing bell, and MKM Partners ’s Rob Sanderson reminds investors this will be the first time they’ll see the effects of lower “load” of advertisements on the company’s properties, after a year of management warning the Street. 
Sanderson, who has a Buy on the stock, and a $200 price target, is referring to statements on quarterly calls by CFO David Wehner of the following sort, from Q2’s earnings call: 
As we have discussed before, we continue to expect that Facebook ad load will play a less significant factor driving advertising revenue growth going forward and that desktop ad revenue growth rates will slow in the second half of 2017 when we begin to lap efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers. 
Basically, Sanderson thinks the sell side has overshot , modeling too much deceleration in revenue growth, and expenses too high, and that could lead to upside: 
Consensus currently reflects about 1,830bps of revenue growth deceleration over the next six quarters, more than double the 710bps over the trailing six quarters […] Expense growth also looks high, with consensus reflecting about 325bps of margin compression (non-GAAP) in 2018 from the level reported in Q2. Management has provided guidance for 40% to 50% growth in expenses for 2017. Expense growth in the 1H was 36%, with consensus reflecting 44% expense growth for 2H. The growth in expense dollars implied in consensus is very high in our view, up $2.1Bn in 2H and another $6.7Bn in 2018. 
"Upside result could create domino effect on consensus,” he muses, "moderating the rate of deceleration through 2018, and could drive more bullish investor sentiment." 
For Q3, then, " We expect the company will beat the 40% revenue growth reflected in consensus, reporting perhaps 43% to 44%,” writes Sanderson. 
Sanderson is modeling revenue for Q3 of $9.83 billion, and EPS of $1.30. That is roughly in line with consensus for $9.85 billion and $1.27. 
As far as whether management will say anything about its 2018 outlook , he notes the company has tended to wait until its Q4 call, in January. Last year was different because expectations were running so high at the time, the company felt it had to say something, he offers. 
For all of 2018, he’s also basically in line with consensus, at $50.844 billion in revenue and $6.62 per share in earnings, compared to the average estimate for $50.92 billion and $6.52.
