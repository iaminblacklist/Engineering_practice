Facebook Denies 'listening' to Conversations 
A Facebook executive has denied the social network uses a device's microphone to listen to what users are saying and then send them relevant ads. However, there have been anecdotal accounts of people saying they were recently talking about a particular subject and the next thing they knew Facebook ads popped up about the same subject. Facebook might be telling the truth or they might not. Considering past history it wouldn't surprise me if they were using the microphone without disclosing that fact. 
"I run ads product at Facebook. We don't - and have never - used your microphone for ads. Just not true," Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice-president of ads, posted on Twitter. Facebook managers have taken to the rival site in recent weeks in an apparently attempt to head off criticism, including over the election.
