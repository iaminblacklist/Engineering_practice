In a discreet move, Facebook increased its number of estimated duplicate accounts from 6% to 10%. It also increased its estimate of fake accounted from 1% to 2 to 3%. These updated numbers will affect Facebook's advertising tools, improving accuracy. While it's still a relatively small percentage of Facebook's user base, the 10% figure means that there are now roughly 207 million duplicate accounts and as many as 60 million fake accounts on the network.
