Facebook is beefing up the capabilities of its dynamic ads for travel , which it initially introduced in May 2016. 
The social network added three new ways for travel providers to generate bookings: the ability to promote hotels and flights; broad audience targeting to reach more travelers; and more creative options. 
The social network said in a Facebook for Business blog post that it expanded dynamic ads for travel to enable businesses to promote relevant flights to users based on their browsing histories or to upsell travelers based on flights they recently booked. 
Broad audience targeting enables businesses to promote relevant hotel offers to users who are most likely to book, and Facebook said the feature is currently available to all hotel advertisers, with flights to be added “in the coming months.” 
Facebook is using social context in dynamic ads for travel to show users that friends have visited cities. 
The social network also introduced the ability for brands to add overlays to their ads to draw more attention to prices or promotions, saying in its blog post, “Overlays are an easy way to capture attention and feature enticing information on top of inspiring creative.” 
Finally, Facebook’s Collection ad format can now be used with dynamic ads for travel, with the social network saying, “The Collection ad format can help expedite the path to purchase by enticing travelers with beautiful visuals and then providing specific booking offers.” Share
