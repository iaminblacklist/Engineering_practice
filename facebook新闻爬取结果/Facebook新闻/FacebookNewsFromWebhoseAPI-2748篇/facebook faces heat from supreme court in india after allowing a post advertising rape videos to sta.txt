Facebook faces heat from supreme court in India after allowing a post advertising rape videos to stay By Taruka Srivastav - 03 November 2017 13:47pm Facebook allowed a post advertising rape videos to stay despite complaints in India 
Facebook is facing heat in India after a submission was filed against it in the supreme court for refusing to remove a page featuring images of children taken in public under which users posted graphic descriptions of sexual abuse for more than a year. 
To make matters worse for Facebook, police in Kerala claimed that a Facebook page was being used to run a child-sex ring and another Facebook post advertising rape videos was permitted to stay online despite being reported several times. However, Facebook said in an affidavit earlier this year that it “investigated all reports and took appropriate action” as reported by the Guardian. 
The news comes at a time when Facebook’s revenue rocketed 47% to hit $10.1bn in Q3, as its advertiser count hits 6m. India has already become Facebook's largest market in Asia Pacific by share (32.6%) of users, according to an eMarketer report. 
The supreme court last week ordered the technology companies involved in the probe, who also include Yahoo, WhatsApp, Microsoft and Google, to work with the Indian government to expand their list of key words associated with child abuse material. 
The supreme court also issued notices to Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the government of India following a petition which questioned the lack of data localization and the issue of user data sharing by WhatsApp. 
To build a safe community, Facebook earlier introduced new technology to prevent 'revenge porn' from being shared on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.
