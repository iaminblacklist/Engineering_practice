Civil rights groups claim that content from activists is routinely removed from Facebook, while the company seemingly fails to “prevent the spread of violent threats and harassment by white supremacist hate groups” on the site. Christophe Morin/Bloomberg – Contributing writer Oct 30, 2017, 7:08pm CDT A former Facebook employee is suing the social network, saying she and others routinely worked more than 40 hours a week without overtime pay. The lawsuit , filed late last week, claims the company skirted overtime laws by classifying Susie Bigger and her coworkers as managers, despite giving them no managerial responsibilities or power. Ars Technica first spotted the filing. Bigger joined Facebook in May 2013 and left the company earlier this year. She worked in a sales role at the company’s office in Chicago, where she helped large advertisers plan their campaigns, according to the lawsuit. “[Client Solutions Managers’] primary duties do not involve the exercise of discretion or independent judgment with respect to matters of significance,” Bigger’s lawsuit reads. “Namely, all major strategic decisions for customers are made at the team level. [Client Solutions Managers] must follow pre-established pricing models for Facebook products and are not permitted to deviate from the preset parameters or which products to offer without prior approval. Likewise, [Client Solutions Managers] do not have the authority to negotiate with customers and bind Facebook on significant matters.” Biggers’ lawyers have asked a judge to grant the case class action status, allowing them to sue for lost wages on behalf of Client Solutions Managers, Customer Solutions Managers and Account Managers at the company. In a statement to Ars Technica, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) said it intended to fight the lawsuit. — Disclosure: Luke Stangel worked at Facebook from 2015 to 2016.
