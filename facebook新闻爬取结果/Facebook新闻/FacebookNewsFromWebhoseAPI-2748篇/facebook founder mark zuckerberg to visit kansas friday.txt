As Mark Zuckerberg ends a U.S. tour the Facebook founder will stop in Kansas Friday for a discussion and live stream. 
Zuckerberg posted on his own Facebook page Wednesday that he planned to make a stop in Kansas Friday, but didn’t divulge where in the Sunflower State he would appear. The stop will include a live stream discussion about what he has learned during a tour of several states. 
In Oklahoma Wednesday he visited a farm and discussed renewable energy. On Thursday he stopped in St. Louis to meet with small business owners. 
While in Missouri, Zuckeberg announced a new program to boost small businesses and improve individual technical skills dubbed Facebook Community Boost, according to his Facebook page. The will “visit” 30 U.S. cities next year offering free training on a range of digital skills including coding, building websites and using Facebook. 
Since January Zuckerberg has been traveling to dozens of states in what he calls his “Year of Travel” challenge. The tour has at times resembled a political campaign as Zuckerberg has met with a large cross-section of Americans, hearing their concerns. However, he has deflected any suggestions of a presidential run.
