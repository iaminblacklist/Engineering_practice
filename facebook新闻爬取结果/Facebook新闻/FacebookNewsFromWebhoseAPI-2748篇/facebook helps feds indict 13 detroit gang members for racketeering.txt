MORE They used to be called "Original Paid Bosses," an east-side Detroit gang that sold drugs out of gas stations, cell phone stores and fish markets.
But after three name changes – and plenty of bragging on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube – the group now known as "Smokecamp" hit a wall: the federal government.
In a racketeering indictment unsealed Wednesday, 13 "Smokecamp" members were charged with a slew of criminal charges, accused of running a violent drug trafficking ring that sold cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, weed and prescription pills. According to the indictment, at least one member was busted selling heroin to an undercover federal agent, while others issued threats on Facebook, as one man did on July 26, stating: "If u ever talk down about smokecamp yo life will be shorter."
Those tips, among others, led to early morning sweeps on Tuesday that resulted in a dozen arrests. Two other wanted suspects, however, remain missing and the justice department is seeking the public's help in finding them.

They are: Darryl Key, “DB,” “Big Baby,” 27, of Detroit; and Carlos Davis, Los,” “Loso,” 24, of Detroit.

Here are some of the social media posts by alleged gang members that caught the attention of federal investigators, and triggered the indictment:
On Sept. 22, 2015, one gang member posted a photograph of himself on Facebook standing in front of a Sunoco gas station with the caption: "Served my first bag on runyon."

On March 23, one alleged gang member posted a picture of himself on Instagram with the caption: "Trappin like I gotta point to prove."
On Feb. 5, one member sent a message via Facebook stating, "i need bud kermit"
On Jan. 7-10, one alleged gang member used social media to find out if anyone had a robbery lined up that he could participate in because he needed money.
According to the indictment, the gang has gone through three name changes over the years, from "Runyon Boys" to "Original Paid Bosses," to '"Smokecamp," which honors a slain member known as "Smoke," who was killed in 2012.
According to the indictment, the gang's turf is known as the "ABlock," which is located around Albion Street and Seven Mile. That's where the gang sold the drugs outside of vacant houses known as "trap houses" and businesses in the area. However, authorities said, the drug activity was not confined to Detroit as some members traveled to Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio to sell.
The indictment is the result of an ongoing investigation by the Detroit One Initiative, a task force led by the ATF and Detroit police gang unit, along with the FBI, DEA and MDOC. According to the U.S. Attorneys office, investigators were able to close in on members of Smokecamp while investigating a similar gang on Detroit’s west side and piecing together information that confirmed criminal activity was going on.
Charged in the indictment are:
• Korey Sanders,“No Loan Corleon,” “Stax,” 26, of Detroit,
• Jerray Key, “Chino,” “Dre,” 28, of Canton
• Deshawn Langston, “Pook,” “Slips,” 26, of Detroit
• Richard Langston, “Dub,” “Rich,” “Blow,” 27, of Detroit
• Hakeem Bunnell, “LB Dub,” 24, of Detroit
• Keenan Nielbock, “Dolla,” “Keno” 30, of Taylor
