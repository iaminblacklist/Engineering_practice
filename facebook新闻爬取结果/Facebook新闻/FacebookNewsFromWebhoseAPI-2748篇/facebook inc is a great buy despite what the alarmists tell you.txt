Breaking news sponsored by Facebook Inc Is a Great Buy Despite What the Alarmists Tell You FB stock is still "likeable" for bullish investors Nov 3, 2017, 10:36 am EDT | By Chris Tyler , InvestorPlace Contributor Get FB alerts: View All 
If you liked Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) prior to a mostly friendly earnings report, then getting reacquainted with FB stock may sound like a good idea. But for bullish traders that are agreeable, rather than getting long shares, a moderately bullish long call butterfly spread is a more likable position. 
Let me explain. 
Social media giant Facebook delivered a super “likable” Q3 report Wednesday night , beating Street profit and revenue estimates on continued, strong growth trends. And traders were caught buying the news in FB stock as shares jumped to record highs in the immediate aftermath of the report. 
But then an unwanted guest dropped in on the conference call and set the tone for Thursday’s 2.05% decline in FB stock. The company announced its 2018 expenses would rise 45% to 60% from 2017 levels. 
Facebook is ready to commit greater resources to cyber-security following the ongoing controversy the role social media and fake news had on the 2017 Presidential election. FB Stock Weekly Chart 
As reported above, investors failed to “like” FB stock following Wednesday night’s earnings report. In the scheme of things though, Facebook’s decline on Thursday can and rightfully should be chalked up to modest profit-taking. That’s sensible enough given 2017’s heady, but steady return of around 58%. 
Looking forward, given FB’s solid quarterly results and without making fake news out of Thursday’s mole hill; shares of Facebook are still in a very constructive uptrend that continues to support buying on weakness until proven otherwise.
