Facebook Introduces Housing Listings in Marketplace 
10 Nov, 2017 Tweet 
On Thursday, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) announced a new update of their Marketplace section where U.S. users can have more options sorting through house and apartment listings. Previously, the only housing listings on the Marketplace were ones that were posted by users directly on the platform. Now, Facebook includes hundreds of thousands more listings from the housing sites Zumper and Apartment List which also includes listings from property managers, brokers, and agents. Users can also filter searches according to their preferences by categories such as price, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, rental type, square footage, and pet friendly listings. Users who are listing a rental are able to upload 360 degree photos as well. 
This new update in the Marketplace section helps Facebook compete with other sites such as eBay and Craigslist as they continue to grow in the industry. Last month, the company also announced new features to help people buy and sell used vehicles. 
"Marketplace is a popular place for people to look for a home to rent," said Facebook's Bowen Pan. "Now that we're adding listings from Apartment List and Zumper, people can search even more options in the U.S. to find a place to call home. First with vehicles and now with housing rentals, we're partnering with businesses to bring more ease and convenience for consumers."
