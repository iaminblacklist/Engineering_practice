Facebook announced that it will begin rolling out a campaign budget optimization tool to advertisers “in the coming months.” 
The social network said in a Facebook Business blog post that the new tool will allow advertisers to set one central campaign budget and optimize spending across their ad sets by distributing budget to the ad sets that are performing the best in real-time. 
Campaign budget optimization is available for any campaign objective, according to Facebook, and it is best-suited for campaigns with multiple ad sets. 
Facebook said the tool will save advertisers time by eliminating manual shifting of budgets between ad sets, adding that advertisers can set daily or lifetime campaign budgets, as well as bid caps and spend limits for each individual ad set. 
The social network said in its blog post, “By distributing more of a budget to the highest-performing ad sets, advertisers can maximize the total value of their campaign. Budget optimization works in real-time to determine the most effective use of a business’ ad dollars to help lower cost per result and increase return on ad spend.” Share
