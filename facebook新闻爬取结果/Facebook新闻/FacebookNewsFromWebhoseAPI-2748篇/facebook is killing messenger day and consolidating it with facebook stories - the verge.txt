Facebook Stories is getting quite the revamp today. According to TechCrunch , not only will Stories between Messenger Day and Facebook be consolidated as of today, but Facebook is also getting rid of Direct, an ephemeral messaging feature.
Previously, disappearing posts on Messenger Day and Facebook Stories existed separately. Now, Facebook Stories will be synced across both platforms, although camera filters will still remain separate. Along with this change, Facebook is also killing private ephemeral messaging feature Direct. Going forward, all replies to Stories as well as Facebook Camera messages will be directed through Messenger.
While Facebook is streamlining many facets of Stories, there is one thing it is adding: collaborative Stories for events . This new feature will allow users to collectively contribute to one Story for an event (like a birthday party or festival), with submissions moderated by the eventâ€™s admins. TechCrunch also notes some smaller changes that are coming along with everything else, including new privacy settings for Stories that will let you restrict who is able to see what you post, and the launch of Facebook Stories for its stripped-down app, Facebook Lite, popular in countries like India, Mexico, and the Philippines.
These changes come as Facebook continues to try and figure out how to get people to adopt using Facebook Stories as part of their regular social media use. It added the ability to create GIFs in August , and recently integrated a new feature into Instagram , which allowed users to simultaneously share their Instagram image or video story to Facebook. But the feature remains wildly popular primarily on Instagram , followed by a version launched on WhatsApp earlier this year.
