PHENIX CITY, AL – One woman's sighting of a massive hog in an Alabama neighborhood is causing a stir on social media. 
“I was in Fontaine Park in Phenix City. I'm not sure if anyone called Animal Control,” Angela Price told WTVM. 
Price says she was scared and shocked that it was just walking around a neighborhood, but she couldn’t resist the temptation to snag a few pictures and video. 
“I just had to turn back around and take some pics,” she said. There were a couple cars slowing down looking as they were leaving Fontaine Park.” 
Price shared the photos and video on Facebook, where they have been viewed nearly 500,000 times. More News
