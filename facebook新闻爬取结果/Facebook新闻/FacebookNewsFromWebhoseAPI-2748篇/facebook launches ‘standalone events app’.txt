FACEBOOK LAUNCHES ‘STANDALONE EVENTS APP’…. 
Facebook launched its Events standalone app, calling it Local. Available for Android and iOSusers , the Facebook Local app features information about local businesses and reviews from Facebook users to help bring together businesses, restaurants, bars, and more with events. 
Launching in the US on iOS and Android, Facebook Local combines events and permanent places to a single search engine powered by Facebook’s 70 million business pages plus reviews and friends’ checkins. 
The Local app will combine calendar and event listings and this aspect could turn the social media platform closer to apps like Foursquare and Yelp that search-and-discover and provide those results for its users locally. 
On the Google Play app listing, the Facebook Local app is described to let users “keep up with what’s happening locally-wherever you are-whether you’re looking for something to do with friends this weekend or want to explore a new neighborhood.” 
Users will be able to see the most recent activity, events, and places your friends are interacting with and updates from event hosts and Pages you follow. There’s also an interactive map and filter by time, category, location and more. SHARE
