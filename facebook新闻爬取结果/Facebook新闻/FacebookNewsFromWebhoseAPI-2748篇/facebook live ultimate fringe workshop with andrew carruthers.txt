Essentials for The Ultimate Fringe 
Blow dry into natural fall – In most cases, fringe is best cut on dry hair to avoid any surprises. Begin by performing a wrap dry through the fringe area with a Sam Villa Artist Series Handle Comb for ultimate control. 
Follow the natural growth patterns – For a fringe guests won’t have to fight with, pay close attention to the natural growth patterns to show how wide the fringe area can be cut and for any natural splits, parts or changes in direction. 
Balance elements of the face shape – Remember, the shape that is created by the fringe has the power to balance out certain face shapes…for wider face shapes, think of diagonal lines or narrow designs; for thinner face shapes, go for a design that opens the face; and to balance out squareness, approach with rounded or tilted (asymmetric) lines. 
Draw attention to the best features - Allow fringe to draw attention to the guest’s best features! Beautiful eyes, cheekbones, lips, jawlines, etc…can all be accentuated by the right fringe.
