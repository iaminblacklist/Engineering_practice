Facebook-Marketing FACEBOOK MARKETING - open to bidding 
HELLO, I AM NEEDING SOMEONE TO ENTER ALL THE CORRECT MARKETING INFO SELECTIONS ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE, THAT WILL GET THE ATTENTION WE NEED. WE ARE A NEW COMPANY, SO WE DON'T HAVE AN EXISTING DATA BASE OF CUSTOMERS. WE NEED OUR PAGE TO GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AND NOTICE THAT'S POSSIBLE WITHOUT SPENDING MUCH, BECAUSE WE ARE DEFINITELY ON A BUDGET UNTIL WE START GENERATING SALES. I HAVE STARTED MY FACEBOOK PAGE ALREADY, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO SELECT IN ALL THE MARKETING SECTIONS. WE ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE CREATING OUT VIDEO AD, AND THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SOON. THIS JOB REALLY SHOULDN'T TAKE MUCH TIME, JUST SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. BASICALLY, OUR MAIL FOCUSED PRODUCT THAT WE ARE OFFERING, ARE SURPRISE JEWELRY CANDLES THAT GUARANTEE DIAMOND JEWELRY INSIDE EVERY CANDLE. WE HAVE A FEW COMPETITORS OUT THERE, IF YOU NEED THE NAMES OF THEM, I CAN GIVE THEM TO YOU. PLEASE LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS.
