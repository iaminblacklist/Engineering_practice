Facebook is introducing a revamped housing category for its Facebook Marketplace storefront in a bid to take on rentals listed on Craigslist and elsewhere. The social networking site is partnering with Apartment List and Zumper to add hundreds of thousands of US listings starting today.
Those searching for a new home or apartment will be able to search via US location, price, bedrooms, size, and if the place is animal friendly. Those looking to rent out their place will be able to upload 360-degree photos to their listing.

It started partnering with car dealership sites in October, for example, to meet demand and make the car buying experience easier.
