Facebook loves to steal Snapchat features to block the popular messaging app’s momentum. Ephemeral stories and messaging have arrived in Facebook , Instagram , and WhatsApp previously, and the company has even lifted Snapchat’s popular face filters and camera features . Facebook is now setting its sights on the streak feature of Snapchat, an addictive game that encourages friends to send messages back and forth for consecutive days.
Like Snapchat streaks, Facebook Messenger streaks include an emoji status for anyone you’re currently in a streak with. Facebook appears to be testing this on limited accounts at the moment. Twitter user Case Sandberg discovered the streaks feature, and other Facebook Messenger users have also noticed it in testing. It’s not clear if this is a limited test that won’t reach all Facebook accounts, or the start of the gamification of Facebook Messenger. Some of Facebook’s Snapchat clones don’t always work out .

— case (@CaseSandberg) November 22, 2017 Streaks have become a popular part of Snapchat, thanks primarily to its young audience. Snapchat uses the feature to encourage its users to send more snaps, and even warns friends when a Snapstreak is about to expire. If Facebook is preparing to clone this, then don’t be surprised to see it show up in Instagram and WhatsApp. If Facebook is desperate enough to steal features from Snapchat, then it’s definitely desperate enough to spread this feature everywhere to keep you engaged with its various services.
