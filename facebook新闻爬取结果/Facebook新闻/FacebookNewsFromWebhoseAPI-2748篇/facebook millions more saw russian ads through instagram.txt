Facebook told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that another 16 million people may have seen Russia-backed posts about the 2016 election, in addition to the 126 million Facebook users who were exposed to that content.
Colin Stretch, Facebook's vice president and general counsel, said the 126 million number the company initially provided did not include users of Instagram, which Facebook owns.
His 16 million estimate of exposure through Instagram is only as of October 2016. He said Russia's reach before then is unclear, but said another 4 million people may have seen ads then.
That brings the new total to “a little less than 150 million [people],” Stretch told the Senate panel.
Facebook had originally announced just 10 million people were touched by Russian influence.
Top executives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter are on Capitol Hill this week to discuss meddling by Russia in the 2016 election by use of social media in an attempt to cause chaos. Tuesday's hearing with the executives before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee was more tame, but senators part of Senate Intelligence came out swinging.
“You bear the responsibility, you created these platforms, and now they’re being misused — and you have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday.
