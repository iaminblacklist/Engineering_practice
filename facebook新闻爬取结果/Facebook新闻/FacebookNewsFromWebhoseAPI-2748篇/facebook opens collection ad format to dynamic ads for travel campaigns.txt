Airline and hotel brands retargeting travelers can now use Facebook’s full-screen, immersive mobile ad format. 
Brands retargeting travel-minded consumers through Facebook’s Dynamic Ads for Travel product can now use its full-screen, immersive Collection ad format for their campaigns, the company announced on Monday. Facebook introduced the iAd-like, mobile-only ad format in March 2017 for retailers who want to not only showcase their wares but sell some by linking a splashy photo or video to a product catalog. Now the company is extending the brand-friendly, performance-minded ad format to airline and hotel brands that want to win over holiday travelers. In addition to extending its latest eye-catching ad format to travel advertisers, Facebook is adding a couple of new cosmetic features for these marketers to grab people’s attention while they scroll through their News Feeds.
