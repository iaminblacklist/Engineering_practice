Ruby Gupta, an executive working in a telecommunication company in Chennai, got the surprise of her life on Monday when Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh assured her all help to get a birth certificate, which was getting delayed for many days. 
“My father tried to get the certificate made for many days, but the Kharar office staff was not giving any headway. As I had to travel to Belgium to meet my husband, there was an urgency, so I wrote on CM’s Facebook page on Sunday,” Ruby, who was born in Kharar, said. “I never expected the response so quickly – which came the next day,” said Ruby, who got her birth certificate made on Tuesday.
