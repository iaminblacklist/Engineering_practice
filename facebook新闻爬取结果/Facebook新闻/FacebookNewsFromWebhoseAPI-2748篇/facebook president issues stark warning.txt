Facebook President Issues Stark Warning   10, 2017 - 09:11 AM Leave a comment Sean Parker, Facebook's founding president, warns of the perils of social networking. (CCM) — Sean Parker, Facebook 's founding president, has issued a stark warning to businesses and parents about the social network he helped to create, according to a BBC report . "It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains," he said. He added that social networks are designed to be addictive without necessarily offering anything beneficial. "The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?' That means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that's going to get you to contribute more content."He admitted that he no longer uses social media sites like Facebook because they are "too much of a time sink," although he conceded that he still has a Facebook account. Before joining Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, Parker was the co-founder of the controversial file-sharing site Napster. His role in the creation of Facebook was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in the 2010 movie The Social Network. Image: © Lukasz Stefanski - Shutterstock.com
