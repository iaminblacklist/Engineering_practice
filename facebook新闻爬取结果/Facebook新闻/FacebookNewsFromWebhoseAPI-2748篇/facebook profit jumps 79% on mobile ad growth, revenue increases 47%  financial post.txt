National Post Facebook profit jumps 79% on mobile ad growth, revenue increases 47% The company is at the centre of a political firestorm in the U.S. for the ways it handles paid political ads and allows the spread of false news stories Tumblr 
Facebook Inc reported a 79 per cent jump in profit on Wednesday as it pushed further into video advertising in a quarter that was dominated by reports that Russia allegedly used the social network to meddle in the 2016 U.S. elections. 
Facebook’s total advertising revenue rose 49 per cent in the third quarter to US$10.14 billion, about 88 per cent of which came from mobile ads. 
Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of US$9.71 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet. 
Net income rose to US$4.71 billion, or US$1.59 per share, from US$2.63 billion, or 90 cents per share. 
Total revenue increased 47.3 per cent to US$10.33 billion. 
Facebook is at the centre of a political firestorm in the United States for the ways it handles paid political ads and allows the spread of false news stories. U.S. lawmakers have threatened tougher regulation and fired questions at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch in hearings this week. 
Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years. Russia denies any meddling. 
The company did not make any reference to the matter in its statement.
