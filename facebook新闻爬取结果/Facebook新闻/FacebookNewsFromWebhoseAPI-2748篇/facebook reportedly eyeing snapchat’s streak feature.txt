Facebook reportedly eyeing Snapchat’s streak feature November 24, 2017 , 9:17 AM IST 
New York: Social media giant Facebook is reportedly looking to clone Snapchat’s streak feature, one that promotes a constant flow of conversation between two users. 
A feature that was spotted by some Twitter users, it was seen that Facebook Messenger streaks include an emoji status for anyone a user is currently in a streak with. While it appears to be in the testing phase, it is unclear whether the feature will be rolled out for all Facebook users, as reported by The Verge. 
For the unversed, Snapchat’s streak feature is responsible to promote constant user engagement by encouraging its users to send more snaps, and even warns friends when a Snapstreak is about to expire. 
Earlier this week, Facebook announced the roll-out of a consolidated stories feature for all those part of the ‘events’ and ‘groups’ pages on the platform, along the lines of Snapchat Stories.
