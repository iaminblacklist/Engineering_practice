November 3, 2017 Media Bias Facebook restored Wexford/Missaukee RTL’s ad account 
By Right to Life of Michigan 
We’re happy to report that Wexford/Missaukee Right to Life of Michigan is able to use advertising on Facebook again! 
Yesterday reporters from Mlive and the Detroit News contacted Facebook about their unexplained ban, and Facebook reversed itself. 
Mlive ran a story today on the issue. 
The restoration was very similar to the ban of the Right to Life of Michigan ad account: Facebook told reporters that they contacted us about the mistake, but that never happened. While it’s positive that Wexford/Missaukee RTL had their access restored, it’s still troubling that Facebook refuses to explain how the mistake occurred, and if they took any steps to remedy the situation for future cases. 
Our best guess is that a disgruntled pro-abortion Facebook user trolled a harmless advertisement of Wexford/Missaukee RTL and reported it as offensive. Facebook automatically banned the page, especially since it’s a smaller community group unlikely to have access to media/someone to take their case up to fix the problem. Facebook’s customer service responses were all automated form letters responses. 
When reporters contacted Facebook, that’s the point a human being actually reviewed the ban and saw it was indefensible. 
That’s our theory, anyway, in absence of some sort of human contact with a company that prides itself on “community.” Nobody should have to rely on reporters to be third-party customer service agents. Facebook needs to resolve this if they want to build “trust” with groups concerned about censorship. 
Facebook somewhat menacingly told Wexford/Missaukee RTL that there was “no further action you may take” to fix the ban. Well, pardon us, but Facebook doesn’t dictate what we may or may not do, and Facebook was wrong here.
