2 hours ago Facebook: Russian Ads Reached 126 Million U.S. Accounts 
Approximately 126 million Americans may have viewed Facebook posts by Russian trolls, the social media company wrote in a letter. Those posts, authored by a Russian group posing as Americans, are believed to have been an attempt to sow discord in the U.S. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said approximately 29 million Americans had posts by the Russian group Internet Research Agency placed on their Facebook pages and that the posts reached approximately 126 million accounts after other users shared them. Stretch wrote that the ads were “seemingly intended to amplify societal divisions and pit groups of people against each other... Most of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”
