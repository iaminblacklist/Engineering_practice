FCC rule change could cause 'runaway media consolidation' 
Facebook now says that 126 million American users were served content from Russia-linked propaganda sites during the 2016 presidential campaign. 
Facebook’s general counsel told the Senate Judiciary Committee that 29 million people engaged in the links from the pro-Kremlin Internet Research Agency, according to CNN . 
Once received by the user, the content was then spread throughout the network and the number exposed reached a total of “approximately 126 million people.” 
The social media network said it cannot be sure how many of those 126 million people — which amounts to more than half of the US voting population — actually read the Russian propaganda. 
Facebook claimed that the Russian disinformation campaign was a small fraction of the volumes of content on its website. Share this:
