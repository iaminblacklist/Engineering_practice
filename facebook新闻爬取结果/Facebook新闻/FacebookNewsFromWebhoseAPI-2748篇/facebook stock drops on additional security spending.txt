@wwd After making her mark in the women’s athletic/streetwear market, Pip Edwards of @p.e.nation is turning her attention to men’s wear. The men’s line, which will include tights, shorts, sweatshirts, T-shirts and more, will offer laying options in designs that morph streetwear and sportswear in breathable and water-resistant fabrics. Pictured here is a look from the new men’s line, which officially launches in January. #wwdfashion @wwd “If I had to choose one, it was Christy Turlington. She was under contract with me when she was 17. She is still perfection. My kind of perfection,” Calvin Klein says of @cturlington. WWD spoke to the designer about his new book, simply titled “Calvin Klein,” and asked if there was one particular model who best exemplifies what the brand stood for. Turlington, pictured here by Bruce Weber in 1989, is one of the many models and celebs pictured in the 480-page book.
