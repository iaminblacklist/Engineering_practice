Got no plans this Friday night? Facebook wants to help you find something to do.
The social network last year launched a standalone app called Events to help users discover activities â€” from festivals and 5Ks to neighborhood fairs and nightlife. Today, that app is getting some Yelp-like features and a new name: Facebook Local .
As TechCrunch pointed out, Events was never hugely popular with users: SensorTower data indicates it only received about 100,000 downloads. Facebook is likely hoping to have more success with Local.
Available for iOS and Android , Local aims to help you discover not only events happening near you, but also restaurants, bars, and other places to visit in your area. This should make it easier to plan what to do before and after an event.
