Facebook is being allowed to hide from what they did with Russia at the same time that President Trump is facing the issue that he had nothing to do with. That is the only possible conclusion that can be drawn. The Mark Zuckerberg led company is ducking, dodging, and outright lying as they pretend to be investigating how Russian pro-Clinton ads appeared on the social media site. 
The Gateway Pundit is reporting that the left is claiming, “[sic] Russia ads on Facebook flipped the election away from Hillary to Trump ,” which of course is the exact opposite of what was uncovered. On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee “ released several Facebook ads and posts linked to a Russian troll operation during and after the 2016 presidential election. ” 
There is no evidence within that shows President Donald Trump guilty of anything, but rather, exposes some questions about the left-leaning Facebook.

It was found that half of the ads were actually pro-Clinton ads, as a matter of fact. Facebook's VP:

Now it has been discovered that Facebook executive Colin Stretch made the false claim that “ the US Senate Judiciary Committee that the total number of those illegitimate ads ” reached “ less than 0.004 percent of all content — or about 1 in 23,000 news feed items .” 
There are two major flaws with this statement, however. To begin with, even if the bogus claim was true, even reaching one person with such practices is illegal. Imagine if Trump had been found to have reached 1 in 23,000 and the things that would have been said about him for it. Donald Trump seems to have falsely accused by Democrats and the left.

Secondly, this number is only reached if the data is fudged so that “ issues ” that Russia used to “ inflame ” the debate are not called biased, which they were. The issues supported and endorsed were largely Clinton platform issues, not Trump’s. 
This fact is being purposefully overlooked by the media, Facebook, and everyone opposed to the current White House leadership. Putin looked to disrupt the U.S. election and Trump got blamed for it. 
These revelations and others are why we are seeing even leading Democrats like House Minority Leader and Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) pulling her party away from talking about impeachment. 
They simply have no other choice.
