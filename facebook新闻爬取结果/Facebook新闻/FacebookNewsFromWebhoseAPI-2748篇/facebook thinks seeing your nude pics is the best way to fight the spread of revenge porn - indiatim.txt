Facebook Thinks Seeing Your Nude Pics Is The Best Way To Fight The Spread Of Revenge Porn 254 SHARES November 08, 2017 254 SHARES 
Facebook is testing a new feature it hopes will help prevent revenge porn incidents on its platform, before they occur. But there’s just one problem. 
To keep someone with an angry ex safe, they need to upload those photos to Facebook’s servers themselves. 
Okay, a little clarity here. Though the photos do make it to Facebook’s servers in a fashion, the company isn’t really storing all your naughty pics. The new tool in question is instead a cryptographic sequence generated from your image, and is similar to how the company prevents child porn from being uploaded on its site. It’s also in use by Google, Twitter, and Instagram. The feature is currently being tested in Australia and, if all goes well, will be expanded globally. 
Basically, someone who fears their ex partner may leak private photos of them is advised to let Facebook create a sort of blueprint of the photo on their server. They can do this by sending the photo in question to themselves on Messenger and then reporting it as “revenge porn”, a new category introduced by Facebook. When that’s done, Facebook’s system then creates a coded hash of the image. 
That doesn’t mean someone at Facebook can see your image. Instead, when someone tries to upload that photo, Facebook’s system will detect the same digital signature that was registered by you and prevent it from going online at all. And this doesn’t work just for Facebook’s main service and app, but also photos shared on Messenger. 
The pilot program seems to be a move spurred on by Australia’s recent intense crackdown on revenge porn. In fact, citizens looking to use Facebook’s new beta feature can even approach the government’s e-Safety Commissioner on the platform to receive help. Don't Miss
