Facebook to cut into profits to prevent abuse Nov 2, 2017 
(CNN) - The head of Facebook said the company will invest more heavily in security. 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday profits will take a hit because of the move. 
This came as the social networking site has been under fire for Russian-bought advertisements. 
According to Facebook, roughly 126 million Americans may have been exposed to content generated on its platform by the Russian government-linked trolls. 
Facebook's general counsel testified before U.S. senators that Facebook had more than 10,000 people working on safety and security. 
The company plans to double that by the end of 2018. 
Zuckerberg said Wednesday that protecting the security of the social network "goes beyond elections."
