Facebook will start requiring buyers of political advertisements to verify their identities and disclose who paid for the ads, reports UPI , which added that the move “brings Facebook political ads in line with federal requirements on political ads in print and broadcast. 
“Under current U.S. law, digital platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter aren’t required to disclose who buys political ads the way more traditional media are required to like television and radio. 
“Facebook, along with other social media and tech companies, has come under scrutiny over the past year possibly for being a vehicle for Russian cyberinterference in American elections. 
“”When it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they’re running, especially for political ads,” a blog post by Facebook Vice President of Ads Rob Goldman said. 
“Going forward, Facebook users will be able to click on a “Paid for by” disclosure on a political ad to see who paid for it, the blog post said.”
