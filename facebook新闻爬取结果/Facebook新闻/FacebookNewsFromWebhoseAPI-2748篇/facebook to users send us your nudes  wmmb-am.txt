Facebook to Users: Send Us Your Nudes posted by Arden Dier - 5 hours ago 
Hoping to keep nude photos of yourself off of social media? Upload them to Facebook. 
While it might seem counterproductive, that's what the social media site is instructing users to do in Australia, where it's testing new "photo-matching technologies." The idea is that once Facebook has access to a photo, it can prevent it from being shared on Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. {"position1": {"id": 6043, "type": "station"}} 
This is done by converting the photo into what the Guardian calls "a unique digital fingerprint that can be used to identify and block any attempts to re-upload that same image." In theory, this allows users to protect themselves against revenge porn before it happens. Facebook says the same process occurs once an intimate photo is reported and removed from Facebook.
