Facebook reported another quarter of record sales, according to Bloomberg. 
Revenue rose 47 percent to $10.3 billion in the third quarter, compared with the $9.84 billion analysts expected on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income excluding some costs grew to $4.71 billion, or $1.59 a share, the company said. Analysts had estimated $1.28 a share. 
Facebookâ€™s results painted a picture of its growing power and influence on the same day its general counsel testified in Congress about how Russian actors used its social-media sites to spread political discord through paid ads and posts. The $100,000 in advertising spending being investigated by lawmakers pales next to the continued boost for the business thanks to growing demand for mobile marketing, especially via video. Meanwhile, Facebook continues to add users, with 1.37 billion people now logging on daily. 
In the statement, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook is serious about blocking abuse, and cautioned that profit may be affected by the additional investment in security the company has promised. The company said earlier this week that it planned to double the number of people working on safety and security to 20,000. More from category
