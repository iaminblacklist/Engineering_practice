MANILA - Facebook wanted to lessen the threat of earthquakes and typhoons to its systems when it decided to locate one of its undersea cables in the Philippines, a Filipino official said Thursday. 
In exchange, Facebook will provide the Philippines spectrum equivalent to 2 million Mbps, which is expected to improve broadband speeds, according to an agreement between the world's largest social network and Philippine government agencies. Gov't partners with Facebook for high speed broadband 
“Iyung underwater cable pag-aari ng Facebook, gusto lang nila padaanin sa territory natin para safe sila doon sa earthquake at typhoon na nangyayari sa norte, mas kakaunti ang breakage kung dito dadaan sa territory natin,” Department of Information and Communications Technology Officer-in-Charge Eliseo Rio told DZMM.

The Philippine Bases Conversion and Development Authority will build the the 2 landing stations for the cable, Rio said.
