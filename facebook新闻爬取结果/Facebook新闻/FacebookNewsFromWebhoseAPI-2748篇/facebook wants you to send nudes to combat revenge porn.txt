Facebook wants you to send nudes to combat revenge porn Published on 09 November 2017 Share F acebook is currently testing technology aimed at shutting down one of the internet’s principal scourges – revenge porn. The program requires those in fear of being victim of a revenge porn attack to send their photos to Facebook before their attacker can. According to a recent poll, 4% of internet users in the US have had their private images shared without consent, with Facebook used to share the image in a reported 68% of cases. Here’s how it works: Anyone in fear that their private images may be shared can pre-empt their attacker by sending their nudes to Facebook, who will then use photo-matching technology to ensure the same photo is not shared by another user. Given the technological advances made in this area in recent times, the scheme appears to be legimate, however, critics have already noted the potential for exploitation of the photos by Facebook employees and the onus that the system places on victims of revenge porn to volunteer their images into the digital space. This pilot program is currently available in the Australia, UK, US and Canada with potential for it to be rolled out across the world. News
