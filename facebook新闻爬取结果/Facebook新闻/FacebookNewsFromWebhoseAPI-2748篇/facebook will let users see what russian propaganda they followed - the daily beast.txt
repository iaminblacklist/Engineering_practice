5 hours ago Facebook Will Let Users See What Russian Propaganda They Followed 
Facebook will let its users see which Russian-created propaganda pages they may have liked or followed, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The company announced that it is rolling out a tool by the end of the year that will allow Facebook users to see which ads and pages they followed on the social media site were created by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency. Incendiary postings by the IRA reached an estimated 150 million people during the 2016 presidential election with the intention of heightening controversy regarding issues like gun rights, immigration, race relations and religion.
