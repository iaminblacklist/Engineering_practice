Social networking site Facebook has made it difficult for users to delete their posts from the site. 
While using the desktop site, the delete option is nowhere to be seen. Clicking the menu button in the top-right corner of posts shows only the following options: Save post, Edit post, Turn off notifications for this post and Show in tab. 
The move was spotted by Matt Navarra with other users saying they’ve experienced the same thing. Some, however, have suggested it could be a bug. It’s not just you…!…Facebook seems to have removed the “Delete post’ option

It is a strange and concerning move, considering many would want to delete posts they later deem embarrassing. 
However, this change and/or bug has only appeared on Facebook’s desktop site so far. The functionality is still available for iOS and Android native app users. As Navarra puts it, there could be a bug in the system affecting a certain number of servers. Must be a Facebook bug.

Facebook, however is not engaging with anyone who has queried the issue. According to The Inquirer , if it’s an experiment, they’re letting it play out, if it’s a bug, they don’t know how to fix it.
