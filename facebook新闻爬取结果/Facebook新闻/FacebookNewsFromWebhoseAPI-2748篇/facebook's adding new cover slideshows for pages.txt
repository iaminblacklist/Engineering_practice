Facebook's Adding New Cover Slideshows for Pages Author share 
Here’s a quick one – following on from their addition of cover videos for Pages , rolled out to most Pages earlier this year, Facebook is now also enabling Pages to add Cover Slideshows to showcase their business and build more engaging Pages. 
First spotted by The Next Web’s Matt Navarra , the new option provides another creative tool for brands looking to build out their Facebook Pages, and boost appeal to Page visitors. 
Of course, you do also have to consider how many people are actually coming to your Page at all – most Pages see the majority of their Facebook traffic coming from news feeds, not from Page visits, so it may be the case that spending too much time sprucing up your Page could provide little benefit. 
But that being said, having a good looking Facebook Page implies a level of professionalism, and definitely, slideshows could provide a solid option on this front, particularly as creating great, optimized videos is not always an option (especially for smaller operators). 
There’s no official word from Facebook as to whether, or when, this new update is being rolled out to all users – we’ve asked and will update if we hear back. 
If you want to check your own Facebook Page view stats, head to your Facebook Page Insights and check the ‘Page Views’ tab.
