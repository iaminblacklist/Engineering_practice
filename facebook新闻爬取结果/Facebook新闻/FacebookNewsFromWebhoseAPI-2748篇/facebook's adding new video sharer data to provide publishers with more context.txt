Facebook's Adding New Video Sharer Data to Provide Publishers with More Context Author 
Facebook’s adding some new data for video publishers, with a listing of ‘ Highlighted Shares ’, displaying the top Pages that are re-sharing their videos. 
As explained by Facebook : 
“Highlighted Shares showcases the top five Pages that have re-shared a video, ranked by views. The video publisher will also be able to see associated insights from re-sharers, like post engagement and average watch time.” 
The new data aims to provide publishers with extra insight into exactly how their videos are being distributed throughout The Social Network, which could help to guide decisions on future content and partnership opportunities. 
For example, if you were to see a significant number of video views coming from a certain Page, you could get in touch and invite them to collaborate, helping expand your community through more direct exposure to their audience. 
The data may also highlight misuses you’d rather not see - which you might not be able to stop, necessarily, but could help you decide on future video content direction. 
This comes on the back of Facebook recently discovering two new errors with their video metrics, on top of the list of metric errors which The Social Network reported late last year. Since then, Facebook has announced a range of third-party verification deals to ensure the accuracy of their data, and win back advertiser trust. 
As they work to do this, expect Facebook to keep introducing new metrics like this to better ingratiate themselves with publishers, by meeting their data demands. 
Of course, you’re then also relying on Facebook to give you accurate info – but surely they’ve worked out most of the kinks by now. You’d think.
