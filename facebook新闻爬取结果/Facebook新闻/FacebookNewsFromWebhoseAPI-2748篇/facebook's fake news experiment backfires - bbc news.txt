Facebook's fake news experiment backfires By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter 7 November 2017 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Facebook Image caption A variety of stories, from some questioning the monarchy to others about the Great British Bake Off, promoted comments questioning their truthfulness A Facebook test that promoted comments containing the word fake to the top of news feeds has been criticised by users. 
The trial, which Facebook says has now concluded, aimed to prioritise "comments that indicate disbelief". 
It meant feeds from the BBC, the Economist, the New York Times and the Guardian all began with a comment mentioning the word fake. 
The test, which was visible only to some users, left many frustrated. 
The comments appeared on a wide range of stories, from ones that could be fake to ones that were clearly legitimate. The remarks, which would appear at the top of the comments section, came from a variety of people but the one thing that they had in common was the word fake. 
"Clearly Facebook is under enormous pressure to tackle the problem of fake news, but to question the veracity of every single story is preposterous," said Jen Roberts, a freelance PR consultant. 
"Quite the reverse of combating misinformation online, it is compounding the issue by blurring the lines between what is real and what isn't. My Facebook feed has become like some awful Orwellian doublethink experiment." 
Many on Twitter also expressed annoyance.
