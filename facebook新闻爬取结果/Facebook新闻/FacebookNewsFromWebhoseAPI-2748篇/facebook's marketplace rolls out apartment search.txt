Facebook ( FB ) is expanding its Marketplace to include apartment searching. 
The social media's Marketplace, its platform designed to gives its users the ability to discover, buy and sell items to people in their community, on Thursday launched the ability to browse and search "hundreds of thousands" of housing rental units. 
Facebook's new Marketplace initiative is being done in partnership with Apartment List and Zumper. 
The initial phase of the rollout will include the ability to search for a specific location, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and pet policies. It also allows those listing apartments to upload 360 photos to an individual listing. 
"Marketplace is a popular place for people to look for a home to rent. Now that we're adding listings from Apartment List and Zumper, people can search even more options in the U.S. to find a place to call home. First with vehicles and now with housing rentals, we're partnering with businesses to bring more ease and convenience for consumers," said Bowen Pan, Product Manager at Facebook. 
Shares of Facebook closed lower on Thursday.
