Facebook's Not Listening Through Your Phone. It Doesn't Have To 
We did just such a test in my first year at Facebook. Code-named ‘Project Chorizo,’ it involved pushing every piece of Facebook user data then available—posts, link shares, check-ins—into the targeting grinder and seeing if it improved ads performance. Before we even got to the performance side of things (and we’ll cover that shortly), we were instantly struck by how small a fraction of Facebook content even triggered interest from the targeting machine. On the order of single-digit percentages of Facebook posts resulted in any sort of reading from the targeting machine. It was like pressing a field of livestock into the sausage grinder, and getting out one hot dog as a result. And Facebook users are a very large herd. 
Herein lies one of the key misunderstandings about Facebook, which I like to call the Narcissistic Fallacy. We’re all the center of our own worlds, and assume our lives terribly important or interesting to outsiders. As a result, we equate what we’d most hate to have revealed with what advertisers (or Facebook) would most like to know. But that’s a completely false equivalence; advertisers don’t care about the vast majority of even your most personal data. 
Put another way: Just because I have a naked photo of you on the internet, doesn’t mean anyone would pay money to see it. 
The same goes for most of your Facebook data, including your conversations. While there are probably a few conversational snippets that would reveal something commercially interesting, the data advertisers really want to use for targeting isn’t on Facebook. No, that data resides instead in your Amazon shopping cart, or your car dealer, or your local Target, or every other place you tip your hand to capitalism about your wants and desires.
