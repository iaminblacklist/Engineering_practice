We‚Äôre going to wrap up our coverage of a senate panel questioning representatives of Facebook , Google and Twitter.
Here‚Äôs what we learned:

The questioning was cordial with a few moments of contention. The companies said they took the problem of Russia using their platforms to tamper in the US election seriously and vowed new safeguards. There was total agreement that Russia specifically had undertaken a broad campaign to meddle in the election on social media platforms. The companies projected competent management of the problem . They were reluctant to acknowledge their inability to identify imposter accounts run by foreign actors and to identify ad buyers. ‚ÄúOf course the answer is no,‚Äù said Facebook‚Äôs Colin Stretch about identifying all politics ad buyers and discerning foreign agents. Challenged about the universe of information about its users that Facebook has access to, Stretch insisted under oath that Facebook had limited access to user information. Both Google and Facebook‚Äôs representatives blamed algorithms for certain undesirable activity on their networks including premium ad buys and the creation of offensive ad targeting on Facebook.

Kennedy is back. 
He asks Stretch if FB can generate lists of teenagers who think they‚Äôre overweight.
Stretch says no.
Kennedy refers to a media report about FB micro-targeting teens during moments of emotional vulnerability.
Stretch: That reporting ‚Äúrelied on an internal document that was overstated...‚Äù
Kennedy: You have the ability to give me a list of people... who are teenagers who are insecure about their weight... just like I believe that you have the ability to go look at senator Graham‚Äôs or me, my profile... can you not?
Stretch: We have architected our system so that I may not.
Kennedy: But you could if you wanted to?
Stretch: It is precisely because blah blah
Kennedy: I‚Äôm saying if you wanted to, is it not the case that you can go to John Kennedy‚Äôs profile and see things about JK as a result of my activity on FB...
Stretch: Any user could navigate to your profile. 
That line of questioning kind of went nowhere.

Franken challenges Salgado and they kind of talk past each other. 
Franken turns again to Stretch. He asks about ad targeting for the topic ‚Äújew hater‚Äù on FB. FB has removed the topic from the ad platform. But how could such categories be generated and allowed to exist.
Did you not know about ‚Äújew hater‚Äù ad targeting until the media told you?
Stretch: ‚ÄúSenator, these categories which of course deeply offensive... were algorithmically generated... we‚Äôre not aware of evidence that they were used.... we don‚Äôt know for certain that they were never used... we‚Äôre not aware of any revenue that was generated using that ad target...‚Äù

Franken‚Äôs back. Can Twitter and Google vow not to take foreign political ads paid for with foreign money?

Graham: Are any of you in the content business?
Stretch: The vast vast majority of content on the platform is user-generated. 
Edgett: We‚Äôre not in the content business.
Salgado: We‚Äôre not in the content business.

Senator Hirono: Can you say that content on your platform did not have some kind of effect on the election?
Stretch: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not well positioned to judge why any one person or an entire electorate voted as it did.‚Äù

Senator Al Franken is up. ‚ÄúThis is something you guys have to deal with and fix,‚Äù he says. 
Then he mixes it up pretty good with FB‚Äôs Stretch.
Franken: ‚ÄúHow did FB   points...   Russia ? Those are two data points. American political ads and Russian money, rubles. How could you not connect those two dots?‚Äù
Stretch says the question of account compromise was ‚Äúa threat our security team was intensely focused on.. in hindsight we should have had a broader lens...‚Äù
Franken: ‚ÄúOK, people are buying ads on your platform with rubles... you can‚Äôt put together rubles with a political ad and go like, ‚Äòhm, those two data points spell out something bad.‚Äô‚Äù
Stretch: We should have..
Franken: Ok OK OK. ...Will FB commit to not accepting political ads in the future paid for in rubles or say the North Korean won?
Stretch: We‚Äôre not going to permit political advertising by foreign actors. 
Stretch: ‚ÄòOur goal is to...
Franken: ‚ÄòMy goal is to get you to think through this stuff a little bit better!‚Äô

Senator Ted Cruz accuses Google and Facebook of serving readers a disproportionate amount of ‚Äúliberal‚Äù news stories and of excluding ‚Äúconservative outlets.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is disconcerting if those political positions become a lens through which American consumers consume news,‚Äù Cruz says. ‚ÄúDo you consider your sites to be neutral public fora?‚Äù
Stretch: ‚ÄúWe think of FB as a platform for all ideas...‚Äù
Edgett: ‚ÄúFree expression and free speech is at the core of the twitter mission...‚Äù
