During a React Summit 2017 in Lagos, React and JavaScript experts and beginners converged to discuss how they could build better products using the framework, and proffer solutions to common challenges in their workflow. According to the organisers, the summit is a community-driven conference for and by developers who share a common passion for React and/or front-end development. At the event, a Lagos-based UI designer and front-end developer, Ohans Emmanuel, spoke on the SVG, animations and innovative interactions in ReactJS Apps. Emmanuel emphasised the need for front-end designers to be concerned about how their designs would interact with end users. Also speaking at the event, a digital consultant and Managing Partner, Gambler Studios, Bolu Oluwagbesan, said start-up founders should be keen on creating tech solutions to address societal challenges, while leading a discussion on growth hacking for scaling early user base. Oluwagbesan gave start-up owners helpful growth hacking tips such as being open to partnership and financial management. Other facilitators at the summit were Kingdom Orjiewuru and Innocent Amadi, who emphasised the need for front-end developers to first consider users’ experience whenever they were designing, and the need for simplicity. According to the Programme Manager, Startzone, Sadiq Adeyanju, the event is an opportunity for innovation hub to unite the big players in the ecosystem, especially those who use React and JavaScript. He said, “At Startzone, we believe in knowledge and information sharing and it is through this that Nigeria’s tech ecosystem can grow. Our events are always driven by this belief.
