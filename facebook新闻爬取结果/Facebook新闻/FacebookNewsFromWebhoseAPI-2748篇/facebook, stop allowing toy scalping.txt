MENU Facebook, Stop Allowing Toy Scalping Toy scalpers buy multiples of the same toy with the sole intention reselling them at a much higher cost. When stores are sold out, due to scalpers hoarding all of them, buyers are faced with paying outrageous amounts for the toy, or disappointing the kids who would have loved to play with it.All over Marketplace are LOL dolls for $35 (retail $10), Fingerlings for $30 (retail $15), etc...Scalpers are screwing over the kids who will not see those toys. Most people don't have the time to make 5 trips to the store to look for it, or can't afford to pay the price that scalpers are asking for them.Please sign this petition to call for Facebook to stop allowing their Marketplace to be used as a platform for toy scalpers to do their scumbag business.
