Facebook, Twitter and Google questioned by Senate about Russian propaganda Posted: Updated: 
Facebook, Twitter and Google were slammed by lawmakers Tuesday for failing to prevent the Russians from placing propaganda on their sites following revelations that millions of Americans were exposed to it during the presidential election. 
"There's a lot I think you could have done earlier," said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who called the tech giants "Johnny Come Latelys" at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism hearing. "You guys have a great responsibility." 
Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said he could not understand how Facebook in particular got duped by the Russians. 
"How did Facebook…somehow not make the connection that electoral ads paid for in rubles were coming from Russia?" he asked Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch. "How could you not connect those two dots." 
"There were signals we missed," Stretch replied. 
"People are buying ads on your platforms with rubles," Franken said. "You can’t put together rubles with a political ad and go, 'Hmmm'?" 
"It's a signal we should have been alert to," Stretch said. 
Before the sometimes contentious questioning got under way, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned that "these technologies can be used to undermine our democracy and threaten our country." 
Stretch agreed. 
"The foreign interference we saw was reprehensible," said Stretch, who quickly added that the ads posted by "bad actors" on Facebook were a tiny portion of the content that appeared on the site. "But any amount was too much."
