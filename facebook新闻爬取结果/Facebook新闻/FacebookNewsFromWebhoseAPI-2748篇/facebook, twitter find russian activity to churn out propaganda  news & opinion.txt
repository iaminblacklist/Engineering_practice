Russian efforts to influence American society over social media may have reached more than half the country's voting population, according to new findings that'll be presented to Congress today.
Facebook, for instance, found that 126 million users in the country may have been exposed to 80,000 divisive political posts written by a Kremlin-back Russian company, according to The New York Times .
Twitter uncovered over 36,000 accounts possibly linked with Russia that generated 1.4 million automated election-related tweets, according to a source familiar with the company's upcoming testimony. Those tweets received 288 million impressions.
Google, on the other hand, found 1,108 videos on YouTube probably associated with a suspected Russian campaign to spread propaganda. The videos attracted 309,000 views in the US.
More details will be presented during today's congressional hearing on Russian interference in last year's election. Representatives from all three US tech companies are set to testify.
Facebook will reportedly disclose that a Russian company called the Internet Research Agency controlled 470 accounts to publish the 80,000 posts. Those posts were served directly to 29 million users, and then liked, shared, or followed by others, magnifying their spread.
Russia's Internet Research Agency, which is notorious for being an internet troll farm, also spent $100,000 to display 3,000 ads on the platform with divisive political and social messages, Facebook claimed last month.
Twitter also tracked over 2,700 users accounts to the Russian company, up from the 201 accounts it initially reported last month. All the accounts have been suspended. In addition, Twitter identified over 36,000 accounts found generating automated election-related content that possessed "at least one characteristic" associated with Russian user accounts.
