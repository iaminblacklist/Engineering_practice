WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google are set to go before senators Tuesday to defend their security measures as new revelations have emerged that Russian-linked accounts reached many more American voters than previously thought. Testimony from Facebook obtained by The Associated Press on Monday revealed that posts generated by a Russian internet agency potentially reached as many as 126 million users. In the testimony, the company said that pages created by Russia's Internet Research Agency generated 80,000 posts on 120 pages between January 2015 and August 2017. Possible views reached the millions after people liked the posts and shared them.
