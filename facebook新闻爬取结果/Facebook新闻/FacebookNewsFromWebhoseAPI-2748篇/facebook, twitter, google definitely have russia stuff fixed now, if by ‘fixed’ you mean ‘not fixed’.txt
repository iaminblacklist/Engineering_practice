Down On The Troll Farm Facebook, Twitter, Google Definitely Have Russia Stuff Fixed Now, If By ‘Fixed’ You Mean ‘Not Fixed’ By Add to Flipboard Magazine. After we hack election, Natasha, we sell CBS pilot for ‘Young Sheldon’! 
Congress is using several hearings this week to yell at lawyers for tech giants Facebook, Google, and Twitter about how Russia used their platforms to muck around in the 2016 election, and to find out what the companies have done to prevent foreign interference in future elections. Turns out the answer to that latter question is they’re working really hard on the problem, you betcha. Just as soon as they figure out the ruble to dollar exchange rate. (That’s a low joke — they already have an app do do that.) 
At least now all three companies admit — a bit reluctantly — they didn’t do the best job last time out. In Wednesday’s hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden asked each of the company reps for a simple yes-or-no answer (a tactic that we’ve always thought hokey, frankly, but we are not a senator) to the question, “Are you satisfied with your platform’s response to foreign interference in the 2016 election?” 
Google’s lawyer, Kent Walker, tried to go with an essay answer: 
“We are constantly doing better,” he replied. Pressed by Wyden, he said, “We could have done more.” 
“I’ll take that as a no,” Wyden said. 
Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, was more direct. “No, we need to do more,” he answered. 
“The same is true,” Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said. Related How Is Facebook Breaking America For Trump And Russia Today? So that’s progress, of a sort, from how Mark Zuckerberg initially said it was “crazy” to think maybe Russia used Facebook to affect the outcome of the election, and told Barack Obama there were hardly any Russian messages on Facebook at all, tovarich. 
As it turns out, the problem was a bit more widespread than just a few memes with adorable kittycats asking “I can haz repeal of Magnitsky Act?” Facebook’s prepared testimony for Tuesday’s hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee explained that between January 2015 and August 2017, content originating on Russia-connected pages had been served to 126 million people, and most of that exposure was thanks to how social networking works: 
Of that, 29 million people saw it because they had liked one of the Russia-linked pages that Facebook has subsequently removed. The rest saw the posts after they spread organically thanks to likes, comments, and shares that propelled them forward virally. […] 
Google disclosed that a Kremlin-linked account spent $4,700 on advertising on YouTube, posting 1,108 English-language videos to 18 YouTube channels. The videos generated 309,000 views during the election cycle. Even Moar Jesus, Facebook, Does Russia Have A Pee Tape Of You Too? More than one senator was less than assured that the companies have done everything possible to get their act together. In the first of the hearings, on Tuesday in the Judiciary Committee, Al Franken still thinks it’s kind of a big deal that Facebook blithely took rubles as payment when it sold political ads to the “Internet Research Agency” troll farm. He asked whether that was a clue that a foreign government might be trying to influence American politics: 
“How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?” 
Franken called on Facebook to reject the use of foreign currencies to buy political ads. But Stretch demurred. “It’s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,” Stretch said. “So it’s a signal, but not enough.” 
At Wednesday’s Intelligence Committee hearing, Democratic Vice Chair Mark Warner was less than impressed with the companies’ progress even in identifying what happened last year, let alone their steps to prevent future interference: 
“I still find it very disturbing that it appears, at least from Twitter and Facebook, that the sense is that all the Russian active measures only originated with one single troll farm in St. Petersburg,” Warner said. “It still appears that most of the work that you’ve provided us is still derivative of your initial reports. 
“I was hoping very much that you would come in today and either say ‘that was absolutely all of it’ or ‘we’ve identified other troll farms or other entities.’” […] 
“You’ve identified 470 accounts from one troll farm in St. Petersburg. There have been plenty of press reports of other troll farms in Russia,” Warner said. 
None of the companies could say they had yet discovered the full extent of Russian use of their services in 2016, but assured Warner they’re definitely still working on that. 
Warner also wanted to know how it is that Facebook bragged about taking down 30,000 troll accounts in the French election, but only 470 in the American one, and asked whether the company had cross-checked the deleted Russian troll accounts from the French election to see if any American accounts were just Franco-Russian skunks trying to romance squirming American voters who didn’t want anything to do with their stinky affections. Facebook’s lawyer, Colin Stretch, told Warner he didn’t know and would have to get back to him, at which point Warner reminded Stretch that Facebook knew when the hearing was scheduled, and that this would probably be on the test. A bit later, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos posted a clarification to Twitter, which seems awfully ecumenical of him: 
So 1) they’re working on it and B) they tried that thing Warner asked about, good for them, though Russia uses different troll accounts for different countries. Note also that Stamos didn’t quite address why Facebook could find 30,000 troll accounts aimed at France, but only 470 aimed at us. Maybe Russia just thinks France is more fun to fuck with? 
Also, California Democrat Kamala Harris wanted to know how much money the companies made off legitimate advertising that ran alongside troll-generated content, and all three lawyers said their companies hadn’t actually done that kind of analysis. Harris wasn’t buying it: 
“I find that difficult to understand because it would seem to me that we would figure out how much you’ve profited from Russian propaganda on your platforms,” Harris said. 
So rest assured, America — the big tech companies may know everything about you they need to microtarget you for advertising, and while they’re still a bit unclear on exactly how widespread Russia fuckery with the 2016 election went, they’re definitely working on it, and should have their analysis of what went wrong in 2016 finished sometime after Russian trolls help get Donald Trump reelected.

I’m sure the Republicans are also deeply concerned about this and are likewise outraged and will get right on trying to do something about it after the 2018 midterms… or the 2020 election or maybe sometime in 2022… 2024 by the latest, we promise… Martini Ambassador 🍸

I’m disgusted to learn that Facebook had data that the Russians were doing stuff as far back as 2015 and did nothing about it. 
I’ve been going back and forth with some people about FB and their thinking is that they want to actually engage and try to change some minds. I’m thinking that FB and Twitter are not going to change anything unless they get hit in the wallet, and the only way to do that is a mass exodus of users. 
I’m already aware of one project to replace Twitter and Instagram thats hitting Kickstarter/Indiegogo next week and I’m totally throwing money at them when it goes live. MynameisBlarney 
They would fucking change if their CEO’s and other high ranking officers get thrown the fuck in prison for treason goddamnit. theblackdog

I think we’ve all had good lessons in how the Republicans’ and corporate America’s love of country goes, just in our recent past. For them it’s always profits over people, and their super patriotism is a thin veneer for corporate success over all. CafeenMan2 
When we were protesting BushCO because of all the Americans dying in Iraq, the right wing line was, “They knew what they signed up for.” 
Then four people die in Benghazi while Obama is President and suddenly the right wing was profoundly concerned with Americans dying overseas. 
Now another Republican is President and they’re right back to, “They knew what they signed up for.” 
Right wingers have no actual principles. Any “principle” they pretend to have is discarded for the exact opposite “principle” when the original one stops working the way they want it to. Paul

I think it really needs to be drilled into people’s heads just how much a conduit these social media outfits are for misinformation. Given that it’s compromised the very electoral process of the United States, time to bring the hammer down on ’em.

Lies are one thing. Lies paid for by a foreign entity to disrupt the political process are another kettle of fish. It still flabbergasts me that this doesn’t have people in the streets every day; if I thought for a second an election I voted in (I’m Canadian) had been compromised by any country, including the United States, I’d be demanding an immediate dissolution of that parliament and a new election be called.

You’re not out of the woods yet, eh. Fascistbook already allows the spread of fake news and psyops about Yr Trudeau and “community organizing” by Nazis. You should see the crap written all over Trudeau’s YouTube channel. It’s digital graffiti, and it should be a crime treated like physical vandalism. Paper ballots are only one aspect of fuddle-duddling with elections. There’s also the soft power of persuasion in exploiting people’s preexisting biases to influence the vote in a way you want.

According to their financial statements, 97% of Facebook’s revenue comes from advertising but they totally have no idea where that money comes from. 
Facebook can somehow make connections between me and someone I’ve met in real life but have had no online contact with, but they totally have no idea where their company’s revenue comes from. Yeah, right. Beanz&Berryz 
I don’t know or do Facepalm or the Tweeter, so I wasn’t quite sure how their systems were so successful at spreading disinformation. I understand it better now… The social networking and viral spread of things I understand, but it’s people believing anything they see on those systems that’s fascinating/dispiriting… 
We here on The Wonkette get, and believe, alot of information… from The Wonkette pros and from lots of non-commentators. The believing is rooted in the historical context of time spent together, electromagnetically speaking. Well, and we’re ignorant libtards… But still… There’s context, and sometimes someone gets something wrongly, and they get corrected/called out. But just believing random shit from the FaceTwitterverse… what is that about? Is there a trick to making bullshit look credible, or are people in the the FaceTwitterverse really just fucking stupid enough to believe any random thing that appears there or that a “friend” likes? MizzMazz 
Yes there is and yes they are. Most folks will ‘like’ something that affirms their own views, and they will pass it on, because it’s easy to do on FB. Ever wonder why FB and Twitter are free? They really aren’t; you’re the product, not the consumer. C4TWOMAN 
IMO it’s a digital version of a reasonable evolutionary bias: being social animals we tend to trust someone warning us about stuff because: 
a. why would they lie? then no one would hunt with them or share berries or have sexxy times with them 
b. if they say a rabid cave bear is coming RIGHT NOW, it makes sense to default to believe them NOW and run, then hang around to check and possibly get mauled. 
Ergo believe first, criticize later makes sense. 
So IMHO these networks hack our natural biases, dialled up to 1,000. Many evolutionary tendencies don’t mix well in post agricultural, industrial society living. And the Internet aggravates this.

And yet, we on the left are notorious for not believing things that sound too good to be true. After all, when Hillary was actually adopting Bernie Sanders policies, the broad reaction from the Sanders supporters was “Oh, she’s just saying that ingratiate herself to us. She can’t be trusted!” 
Yet random Facebook posts that Hillary all but ate babies could be trusted…? C4TWOMAN 
We on the left are more likely to go out of our way to be aware of our biases and learn critical thinking skills. The right uses fear to encourage fight/flight responses and actively mocks self awarness and education. I think that explains a lot of it. Gussie Jives 
And I think that’s the key difference. It’s certainly what I look for in those I associate with; I have no time for those unwilling to challenge their own biases and privilege. As a cis white guy, I’ve been doin’ a lot of challengin’. WeaselPoo 
Most of my adult students have been Facebookworms(?), and sorry to say that being fucking stupid and believing any random thing would be reasonable characterizations; ergo imho Facebook users are on average, not the sharpest sponges in a room full of elephants. Biel_ze_Bubba 
Keep in mind that we’re talking about people dumb and gullible enough to vote for Trump – there was a perfect match between the audience for the candidate and the audience for the bullshit. Beanz&Berryz 
The “I saw it on the Internet” crowd… Gussie Jives 
It’s part confirmation bias, but I think… frankly… it’s just gullibility. I’m just speaking for me, but I’m slow to accept most things presented to me at face value. Even reading my local paper The Toronto Star, which is most widely-read the progressive publication in Canada, I still find myself scoffing at bad columns from columnists I actually agree with most of the time, usually because I’ve read some other analyses in sources like the Tyee, CBC or even the Globe and Mail from time to time. 
Information moves so fast that hot takes have become the norm; there’s no time to consult a few other sources to confirm facts, it has to be out NOW before another outfit gets the scoop! You hot take enough, you start believing them from sources you’ve trusted in the past and skip the part where you slow down and verify what you’re saying is correct. A lot of people don’t even make it through the byline, they just stop at the headline and think they know the whole story. 
This is bad for civics in general and I don’t think it’s sustainable. If it keeps going… well, lot of gullible folks out there willing to buy bridges and Hillary conspiracy theories. calliecallie

Exactly. I don’t use Facebook myself; Twitter can be useful for getting info directly from major news sources, like subbing to the BBC or CBC or Reuters, but people really should be smarter than to believe random memes promoted by “KEK4EVR_88” (looking your way, Doofus in the Oval Office). 🍁 Girl Guide Salute 🖖🏻 
Twitter needs to be shut down too because they haven’t done anything about harassment or trolling besides lip service for PR purposes. Reddit is another one that’s irredeemable cancer.

Mark Zuckerberg: “This stuff about the Russians using our platform to influence elections is getting out of hand, so I’ve decided we’re going to do our own investigation of this matter, and I warn you, ladies and gentleman, we’re going to probe into every dark corner, every nook and every cranny.

The plan to use FB to influence the election started back in 2009 after Obama won.
