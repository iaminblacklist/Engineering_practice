Under oath, Facebookâ€™s top lawyer, Colin Stretch told the Senate Intelligence Committee, the total amount volume of Russian ads were approximate .004% of Facebookâ€™s newsfeed. 
That means that the entire storyline that the media has been running to say that Russia used Facebook to get Trump elected is totally false. Facebook's VP:

This needs to get out. The media keeps on saying that fake news won Trump the election. Thatâ€™s a total lie. Trump won because Hillary was the worst candidate to ever run for the office. 
We need to stop the Russia crap right now. Share this if you think that we need to kill off the Russia investigation. I t is a complete fabrication
