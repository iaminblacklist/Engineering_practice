Factory operator jailed four months for insulting PM on Facebook Published: Modified: 2017-11-17 18:05:08 
A factory operator was sentenced to four months’ jail by the Petaling Jaya Magistrate's Court today after he pleaded guilty to uploading a cartoon illustration of Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak, with offensive words, on his Facebook account last month. 
Magistrate Mohd Azali Ibrahim meted out the punishment on Mohamad Hamizan Ghazali, 24, and ordered him to serve the jail sentence from the date of arrest on Nov 12. 
Mohamad Hamizan committed the offence using his Facebook account “Ieyzan Ghazali” at Jalan Melati 2, Taman Paya Rumput Perdana, Malacca Tengah, Malacca, between 12.01am on Oct 20 and 5.30pm on Oct 22. 
The charge, under Section 233(1)(a)(ii) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 and punishable under Section 233(3) of the same Act, carries a fine not exceeding RM50,000 or a maximum jail term of a year, or both, upon conviction. 
Mohamad Hamizan, who was not represented, appealed to the court for a lighter sentence on the ground that he had been remanded for five days. 
Deputy public prosecutor Abu Arsalnaa Zainal Abidin, however, pressed for a deterrent sentence.
