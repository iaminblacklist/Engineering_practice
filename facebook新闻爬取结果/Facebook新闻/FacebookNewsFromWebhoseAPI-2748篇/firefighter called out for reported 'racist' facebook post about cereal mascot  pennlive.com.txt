Firefighter called out for reported 'racist' Facebook post about cereal mascot Updated on October 30, 2017 at 12:10 PM Posted on October 30, 2017 at 11:48 AM Comment By Barbara Miller 
LEBANON, Pa. (AP) -- A Pennsylvania firefighter has been denounced by his fire company after racist comments he made on Facebook about a Kellogg's cereal mascot. 
Justin Snyder, a firefighter with Speedwell Engine and Hose Company in Lebanon, made the comments Wednesday on his Facebook page. The Lebanon Daily News reports Snyder was reacting to a national news story that Kellogg's would be redesigning the Kellogg's Corn Pops cereal box after they received a complaint on Twitter that the art was racially insensitive. 

The box shows cartoon Corn Pops hanging out in a mall. The only brown Corn Pop depicted is working as a janitor. 
Speedwell Engine and Hose said Thursday that Snyder's comments do not represent the company and they are taking actions to address the matter. 
A phone message seeking comment from Snyder wasn't immediately returned Monday. View Comments
