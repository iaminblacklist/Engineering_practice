Former Facebook president Sean Parker has gone on record to slam the creators of the social media giant for knowingly exploiting vulnerability in human psychology. "The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them,...was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?'" Parker, who now chairs the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, told Axios in an exclusive one on one . 
"And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you... more likes and comments. It's a social-validation feedback loop... exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology." 
Parker said that Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and other social-media pioneers have been aware of this phenomenon from the start, but, they've been doing it -- psychologically exploiting people -- anyway. 
"The inventors, creators -- it's me, it's Mark (Zuckerberg), it's Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it's all of these people -- understood this consciously." 
Parker, was part of Facebook once, and therefore shares the blame of the social media network's psychological exploits. At least some of it was unintended, he admits. "I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because (of) the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or 2 billion people and... it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other... It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways." 
Parker understands that Facebook isn't the same as it was back in the day. It's grown, and it's grown faster than anybody - even Zuckerberg - would have imagined. Which is why, he's afraid. "God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains." 
Parker's apparent confession that Facebook - and other such social media platforms - can have impacts (psychological as well as non-psychological) on the real world is fast becoming evident. 
The blue whale challenge is a classic example of how social media platforms can have life-threatening psychological impact on people. At the same time, these platforms have become so influential that they now have the potential to alter events as critical as the general elections . Fake news has been a trending topic, for the larger part of this year, and a lot of this - when you dig deeper - originates from social media: which is why there are even dedicated programs these days on popular news channels trying to decode their authenticity. 
Social media began as a means to engage with family, close friends, and acquaintances. But slowly and steadily it has gone on to become a drug, as pointed out by Parker. It's addictive, and therefore, is in dire need of some constraint. Not on the part of its makers, but on the part of its millions of users who've become hooked to it. It's high time they took a detour.
