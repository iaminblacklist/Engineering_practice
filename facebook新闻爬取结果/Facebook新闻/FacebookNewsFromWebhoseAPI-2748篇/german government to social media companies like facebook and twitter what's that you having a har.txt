17 hours ago Pocket Ninja : This is actually more a case of the government telling companies that they must follow their own written guidelines regarding abusive behavior in a timely manner, but don't worry. I still think you're special. It's a case of a government claiming total jurisdiction over a product hosted and maintained almost entirely outside of the government's actual real jurisdiction, on the grounds that a certain number of non-paying participants have at some undefined point in the past accessed it. Made extra stupid by the fact that the service is almost 100% user-created content.Basically a whole lot of "yeah, good luck with that" in here. There's really no way for them to enforce those kinds of fines, and there's no way to both firewall out large portions of the internet and also have an actual first-world economy (they can ask China about that shiat), so honestly FB has more leverage to just say they aren't paying than Germany has to make them pay.// I mean, they're allowed to do the censorship thing. I think a lot of Americans forget that a lot of nations don't actually consider freedom of expression or association to be civil rights, Germany among them. That's not the problem. The problem is that this is like if Australia passed a law fining Trump a billion dollars unless he stops spray-tanning, and claimed they could totally do that because his picture is totes in australian newspapers all the time and that totally gives them rights over his image, for realsies.
