Marketing de Facebook GRAPHICS DESIGN FOR FACEBOOK ADVERTISING GUIDE- REQUIRES FACEBOOK ADVERTISING BACKGROUND 
But we do need a Provider who has a good Working knowledge of the steps that are taken to create a FACEBOOK AD . 
We are LOOKING for a STRONG Graphics designer who can make our current Instructional FACEBOOK ADVERTISING Guides Look better than they currently do + Be able to start from the beginning of a FACEBOOK AD and place ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS Inside of our PDF GUIDE. 
We will give you the EXACT TARGETING AND PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS for EACH guide that you create. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THE "CREATIVE" WORK FOR THE AD IN ORDER TO MAKE AN AD SUCCESSFUL. We have ALREADY done the "CREATIVE" for each guide You just need to insert our creative into the guide. 
So the end result will be this when you "complete a guide" the user who is following that guide will be able to "easily" create a Facebook ad using the instructions and illustrations you have implemented in to the guide. The goal is to make the guide look as close to the actual FACEBOOK AD process as possible so a user can easily follow your guide instructions to create their own ad 
HERE IS WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING- CREATING 7 GUIDES 
We have (7) guides and each guide is about 15 pages long ( filled with instructions and illustrations) 
SEE ATTACHED GUIDE ON THIS BRIEF THAT WILL SHOW YOU THE TYPE OF GRAPHICS AND TEXT YOU WILL ADD 
WE HAVE ATTACHED A SAMPLE GUIDE SO YOU CAN SEE HOW OUR GUIDES CURRENTLY LOOKS. AGAIN- you will need to start at the beginning of each guide and FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE FACEBOOK AD STEPS ONLINE and create your own guide (we will give you a "model" to go off of. 
*** THIS WILL LEAD TO MORE WORK IN THE FUTURE. FACEBOOK ALWAYS CHANGES THEIR AD LAYOUTS SO YOU WILL BE MAKING even more CHANGES IN OUR GUIDES EACH TIME THAT HAPPENS :)) 
NO GENERIC COPY AND PASTE BIDS OR "PLACEHOLDERS" Read brief and reply appropriately. Take a look at the attached guide and make your bid based on you making (7) guides (similar) to the attached where you will follow along on Facebook from the start to the end of a Facebook Ad creation. But your guide version must be much nicer and cleaner and have nicer illustrations than our attached guides. We are not graphics pros- so the current guides u see attached are not very good. YOUR GUIDES MUST LOOK BETTER
