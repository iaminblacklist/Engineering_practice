Halloween 2017: Google joins in celebrations with an adorable ‘Jinx the ghost’ doodle 
Halloween, celebrated on October 31 every year, is considered as one of the spookiest festivals. It is believed that the origin of the festival dates back to the ancient Celtic harvest festivals. On November 1 the Celtics observed their new year and as days grew shorter and nights became longer, the day came to be associated with the end of summer. This beginning of winter and the end of the harvest season was associated with death and ushering of ghosts. 
This Halloween, wish your friends, relatives and loved ones a happy Halloween with these texts, Facebook messages and Whatsapp greetings.
