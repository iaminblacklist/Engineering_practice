Hoover On Facebook: Thanks God, Family, Supporters Amid Harassme - LEX18.com | Continuous News and StormTracker Weather Member Center: Hoover On Facebook: Thanks God, Family, Supporters Amid Harassment Scandal Posted: Updated: Kat Russell / AP 
(LEX 18/AP) -- Saying he may have had a "light heart attack," Kentucky's former Republican House speaker addressed the sexual harassment scandal that threatens his political career and a recent health scare. 
"I truly thank God for the disruption and problems in my life over the past few weeks and my failings," Jeff Hoover writes in a lengthy message posted Monday on his Facebook page. 
Just weeks ago, Hoover, 57, acknowledged he was among four lawmakers who settled a sexual harassment allegation outside of court with a member of the House Republican Caucus' staff. 
After the settlement was reported, Hoover publicly denied the harassment allegation, saying he sent inappropriate but consensual text messages. 
While Hoover resigned his leadership position, he remains in the legislature. House GOP leaders have hired a Louisville law firm to investigate the matter. 
Days after resigning the post, Hoover was hospitalized with what was described at the time as a heart-related issue. 
In Monday's post, Hoover said the hospitalization shook him up. 
"My recent health scare (including in all likelihood a light heart attack three weeks ago) has certainly gotten my attention as well." he wrote. 
But the bulk of the message focuses on spirituality and family and friends. 
"I know and have admitted I have fallen short and for any disappointment or embarrassment to my friends, I am truly sorry," he says. 
Hoover had been elected speaker in January, the first Republican to have the job in nearly 100 years. He has been in the legislature for 20 years. WEATHER
