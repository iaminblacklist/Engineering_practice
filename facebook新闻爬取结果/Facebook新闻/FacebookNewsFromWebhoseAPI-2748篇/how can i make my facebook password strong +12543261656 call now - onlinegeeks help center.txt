How can I make my Facebook password strong? +12543261656 call now When you create a new password, make sure that it’s at least 6 characters long. Try to use a complex combination of numbers, letters and punctuation marks. If you see a message letting you know the password you entered isn’t strong enough, try mixing together uppercase and lowercase letters. You can also make the password more complex by making it longer with a phrase or series of words that you can easily remember, but no one else knows. Keep in mind that your Facebook password should also be different than the passwords you use to log into other accounts, like your email or bank account.
