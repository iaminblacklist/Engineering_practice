Rather than mindlessly chasing people who are not your perfect prospects, it is far more effective to change people’s beliefs and turn them into the perfect prospect. 
Ask yourself this: 
-what problems do my target market face? What can I do to solve them? 
-What do I know about my area of expertise that most people don’t? 
-What are the common mistakes or misconceptions surrounding my topic? 
-If you were to sit down next to someone and speak with them, what beliefs do they currently hold? (and how would you transform those beliefs to benefit that person?) 
Let’s look at the common beliefs in my marketplace. 
-My target market can’t be found on Facebook. 
-Facebook is too competitive for B2B. 
-Before I can sell online, I need to build up an email list. 
-I’m terrible with technology, so It’s impossible for me to learn online marketing. 
-Nobody would ever sign up to something after a single phone call. 
-My programme must be delivered in a one on one setting, and couldn’t possibly work if set up as a group programme. 
Because I am very aware of the limiting beliefs held by my marketplace, I am easily able to help them transform those beliefs with every piece of content that I put out. 
In doing so, I turn a non-believer into a believer, and I show them that they can build a profitable Facebook ad funnel. 
Now, it’s your turn. 
Figure out the beliefs held by your target market, and seek to transform them with your content.
