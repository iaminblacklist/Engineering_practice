How To Get Facebook To Recognize When Youâ€™ve Updated Your Shuffle Card by Lynn Huber on November 6, 2017 
I know this can be really frustrating when youâ€™re using a Shuffle Card to promote each campaign, so I have a tip for you today. 
Youâ€™ve created a Shuffle Card for your Avon Campaign. Youâ€™ve posted it on Facebook, and many people have come and looked at your Shuffle Campaign Card. Itâ€™s working great! 
Now, itâ€™s a new Avon Campaign, and youâ€™ve edited the card to reflect the new campaign, and post it on Facebookâ€¦ and itâ€™s the old card that comes up! 
Many Reps have gotten frustrated and thought they needed to create a new Shuffle Card every campaign. But thatâ€™s not true. 
Facebook uses a technology where, whenever it sees a link, it stores the information in a database. Itâ€™s sort of like cookies on your computer. 
When you post the same link a week or two later, Facebook doesnâ€™t actually go to the link to get the correct image â€“ it automatically pulls it from itâ€™s own database. Thatâ€™s how Facebook keeps its site quick and efficient, even though there are millions of people on it every day. 
So all you have to do is tell Facebook that youâ€™ve changed your card. Itâ€™s easy, and Iâ€™m going to show you how right now! 
So hereâ€™s my current Campaign 25, 2017 card. 
When I go to post it on Facebook, this is what I getâ€¦ 
Not quite what I wanted. 
So Iâ€™m going to take advantage of Facebookâ€™s Developer Tools at this link: 
Hint, youâ€™ll want to add this to your bookmarks ðŸ™‚ 
I entered my Shuffle Cardâ€™s link, and clicked on Debug 
Notice, it pulls up my old card. Youâ€™ll also see some warnings, and lots of information you probably wonâ€™t understand. You can just ignore those. Just click on Scrape Again. 
Most of the time I have to click on Scrape Again two times before it actually gets the correct image. But now it is showing the correct image. 
Now when I go over to Facebook to post my Shuffle Campaign link, this is what I see. 
And there you goâ€¦ all fixed! 
So get out there and edit your Shuffle Cards as much as you want! 
And if you don't have a Shuffle Account yet, click on my card , and you'll be given an option to create one for yourself. It's free for 14 days, and then only $10 a month. The best $10 a month I ever spent! ðŸ™‚

p.s. This tip is not only for Shuffle cards. It will also work with any link you're trying to post to Facebook that's having problems!
