COBDEN â€” According to a Friday morning Facebook post, the iconic Yellow Moon Cafe in downtown Cobden is for sale. 
The Facebook post does not say why the owners are looking to sell the business, which opened in 2009. 
"Since opening the Yellow Moon Cafe in 2009, it has been our philosophy and mission to generate, support, and maintain relationships with many local businesses, area cabins, bed and breakfasts, wineries, breweries, farmers, artisans, musicians, orchards, and more," the post reads. "We are founding members, and currently ongoing supporters of the Cobden Community and Business Association. Our stage venue continues to be a platform where we host International, National, & State musicians, as well as local favorites. Rent/lease is affordable." 
The owner was unavailable on Friday afternoon to discuss the sale or say what the future plans included. 
Judy Travelstead, a board member of the Union County Historical and Genealogical Society & Museum, said she heard of the restaurant's closing about a week ago, 
"It's going to be a tremendous loss for the village, for the area," Travelstead said. "They have made a tremendous impact in the time they have been here." 
Travelstead noted that the restaurant's appeal extended beyond Cobden, attracting people wanting good food and good music, which the business hosted in terms of live entertainment. 
The restaurant is a few doors down from the Anthill Art Gallery, whose owners also recently announced in October they are closing their store after 10 years; that business is also for sale. 
"They pulled people from great distances, both of them," Travelstead said of both Yellow Moon Cafe and Anthill Art Gallery. "Losing both those businesses is going to be tough."
