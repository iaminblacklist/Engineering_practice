Indon-Four men arrested for spreading 'deviant' pornography on Facebook Author Reputation: 6 The Jakarta Post A 42-two-year old man had an inclination for sexual activities involving bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism (BDSM), which in itself does not constitute a crime given its lack of regulation in the country. But his frequent sharing of photos and videos of his BDSM sexual activities in some Facebook groups since last year led to his arrest by the National Police on allegations of displaying a â€œpornographic act in public," which is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison under the Pornography Law.
