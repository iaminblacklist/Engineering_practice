Jim Davidson slams Cornish hotel and has dig at Lenny Henry in Facebook post "Looked loverly downstairs. But run by millennials" Share   Thank you for subscribing!   
Jim Davidson, who for some reason still gets work as a comedian, has taken aim at a Cornish hotel. 
Davidson, 63, was playing a gig at the Regal Theatre in Redruth on Tuesday night, and was staying in the west Cornwall town after the show. 
The comic – abrasive and combative as ever – made his sentiments clear even before he arrived in the county, giving Cornwall Live a suitably predictable interview beforehand. 
And afterwards he took issue with his accommodation (which for some reason he doesn't name). 
Davidson wrote: "Last nights [sic] hotel in Redruth. Looked loverly downstairs. But run by millenials. No heating or hot water." 
He then criticised two businesses in Exeter, Devon, complaining that one 'stank' and that one didn't have a car park, before saying he was staying in a Premier Inn, which would be OK "as long as Lenny F*cking Henry don't [sic, again] show up." He has an OBE (Image: AFP) 
Five hours later, and he was embroiled in another row on the social media platform. He decided he didn't like the Corn Exchange in Exeter, which he accused of failing to let him into the venue, of having a broken PA system, and of failing to meet his technical rider. 
Many of Davidson's gripes, if true, are reasonable aggravations. And he apologised to fans for the cancellation. He said he felt the venue (Corn Exchange) "did not want me there". 
But his comments are sure to rile others up. Good marketing for his shows, isn't it. No-one from venue has yet been available to comment, and no comment has been made online from anywhere else. Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now
