MYSURU: In an effort to popularise Kannada literature , and the 83rd Kannada Sahitya Sammelana among youngsters set to begin on November 24, the organisers of the conference have created a Facebook page on the event, while also opening a Twitter handle for the sammelana.
The Mysuru branch of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat decided to use social media platforms to popularise the upcoming conference in the city to reach out to Kannadigas across the world, on the advice of deputy commissioner D Randeep. The decision to use social media as a viable platform for publicity comes close on the heels of the district administration successfully using Facebook and Twitter for the Dasara celebrations.
Since the literary conference is returning to the 'Heritage City' after 27 years, there is a palpable sense of excitement in the city. President of the publicity committee for the sammelana, HC Janardhan told STOI, "The district administration used social media to promote both International Yoga Day and Dasara. So, we did not want to lag behind in promoting the sammelana. Many people cannot attend the conference but can follow the activities on social media sites, which will be constantly updated."
Janardhan added that the Sammelana would be streamed live on its facebook page, besides a special hashtag being used for the event. "The tweets and posts will be in Kannada, and they will provide snippets of knowledge on Kannada literature, writers and poets," he added.
The Twitter handle — @83rdkasammelana — has been active for the past 20 days, and currently boasts 40 followers. With a minimum of five tweets every day, the conference is being actively promoted on the web. On the other hand, the Facebook page is called '83rdKannadaSahityaSammelana'.
On both Twitter and Facebook, photographs of Kuvempu, his house and lines from his poems extolling the greatness of Kannada and Karnataka, have been posted.
Janardhan pointed out that hoardings of the event would be posted along the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway as part of the publicity campaign. "Posters will also be put up at malls. A dedicated advertising vehicle will roam the city, while posters will also be pasted at 'Trin Trin' docking stations. We will also have short videos on social media," he added.
