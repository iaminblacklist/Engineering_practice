The Christmas season seems to start earlier and earlier each year. I find that by the time the holiday actually comes, I'm so Christmassed out I'm not even excited. If this happens to you too, I've found a way to limit Christmas a little bit: I've removed it from my Facebook feed -- in my browser at least -- until after Thanksgiving. Here's how to do it.
It's OK to be a Grinch There's a nifty browser extension called Social Fixer that allows you to filter out anything you find annoying on Facebook. Politics, religion, sports -- you name it. This is also the only extension I could find that would work to filter Christmas topics. 
It's pretty easy to use, too. 
Install the extension (on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and more). You'll see the Social Fixer extension button -- click on it while using Facebook, then click Options . Choose the Hide Posts option on the right side of the pop-up screen. Then, add Christmas-associated words to the keywords and phrases box. Some good words to add are:
Christmas 
Xmas 
Santa 
gifts
Rudolph reindeer Just type in keywords to filter the posts you see on Facebook.

Now, this doesn't work 100 percent of the time. You'll still probably see memes occasionally (it can't block just images), but your aunt's posts about every Christmas tree ornament she bought this year should be gone.
