ELIZABETH CITY., N.C. (WVEC) -- "What the world needs now, is love, sweet love." 
One little boy in Elizabeth City wanted to use Jackie DeShannon's lyrics to spread an important message in the wake of an attempted prison break at Pasquotank Correctional Institution where four employees died . 
His name is Abel E. and his nearly two-minute long tribute to the victims has taken Facebook by storm. 
"Our community is hurting. The answer is love. God is love. I dedicated this song to the victims and their families," Abel says to kick the video off. 
He then begins to serenade Facebook users with a sweet rendition of "What The World Needs Now," while switching through cards with the victims' names. 
Veronica Darden. Justin Smith. Wendy Shannon. Geoffrey Howe. 
Those were the prison employees who died nearly a month ago. Those were the names Abel held in his hands before casting them to his side, revealing two more cards that said 'Community Strong' and 'NEVER forgotten'. 
But the video's end is what really takes hold of your heart. In fact, Abel's video has earned him more than 4,000 shares and 2,000 reactions. Just take a look below:
