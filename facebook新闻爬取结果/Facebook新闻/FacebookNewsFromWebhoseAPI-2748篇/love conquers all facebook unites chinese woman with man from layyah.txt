In yet another cross-border love story, a Chinese woman travelled to Pakistan to be with a man from Layyah she met in 2015. 
Abdul Khaliq and Li Guihua befriended each other on Facebook, never knowing theyâ€™ll end up together one day. The friendship eventually mushroomed into love and both decided to get married. 
Khaliq travelled to China this year after Guihua sponsored his visa and the two got married there. 
They then came back to Pakistan and celebrated their valima on October 26. 
Early this year, another Chinese woman visited Pakistan to marry a man she met on Facebook. 
Li Yu Cian arrived in Pakpattan where she got married to Shafique in a traditional ceremony. Advertisement
