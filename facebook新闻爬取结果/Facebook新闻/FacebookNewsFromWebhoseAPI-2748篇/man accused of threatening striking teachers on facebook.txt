A Pennsylvania man accused of threatening to shoot striking teachers wrote on Facebook that "guns don't kill people, I kill people," authorities say. 
George Shallenberger also wrote "shoot them and start over" in a social media post about the teachers in the Ringgold School District. He was arrested on Thursday. 
Another post on his Facebook page, "Happiness is a warm gun," happens to be the name of a Beatles song.He also wrote that "f---ing school teachers need to get real jobs. Damn snowflakes." 
Teachers left the picket lines after the threats surfaced. George Shallenberger was charged with two counts of terroristic threats. (Police Handout) 
"Police handled it quickly," Ringgold Education Association president Maria Degnan told WPXI . "The district opened their buildings to say, hey, if the teachers wanted to come off the picket line, they don't feel safe and suspect apprehended, please come in. 
"I don't think this one incident has brought down the resolve these teachers at all." 
Shallenberger is a parent in the school district, according to WPXI. 
"It disgusts me to an extent that there's a parent that felt the need to take it to that point," Ringgold senior MacKenzie Miller told the station. 
Teachers walked off the job Oct. 18 while arguing for better salaries and health care costs. The union says they hope both side can come to an agreement by Monday. 
"For years in the Ringgold School District, we go to bargain and they force us to go backwards in our salary schedule and our benefits and everything else. Weâ€™re hoping that from this point we can move forward," Degnan told CBS in Pittsburgh last month. 
Shallenberger, a Finleyville resident, was charged with two counts of terroristic threats.
