Comment Man Born Without Thighs Finally Finds Love with a Tall 19yr old Girl he Met on Facebook 
A man born without thighs because of a rare medical condition has found love with a woman he met on Facebook. Nathan Hrdlicka, who is 1.37m (4ft 6in) tall, has been called a ‘midget’ but is now happy in a loving relationship with girlfriend Chelsee Stuart. When 34-year-old Nathan, from Santa Fe, New Mexico, met 19-year-old Chelsee – who is at least a foot taller than him – online, she initially saw his height as a ‘problem’. 
But then she fell in love with him and has seen past his disability. 
The couple have revealed their height difference draws stares but people can see they are in love. Check This Out: ⇒ Dino Melaye Parks His Ferrari Convertible At Transcorp Hotel With The Top Down ; See Photos 
Nathan is one of just 25 people in the world born with tbilateral proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD) type D – which means his knee bones are directly beneath his hip bones. 
Nathan – who doctors said would have grown to be over 6ft 4in – says his condition brings him a lot of pain. 
‘There’s only 25 people in the world with my condition. It makes me feel pretty unique,’ he said. ‘As far as I’ve been told I am the only one who has figured out how to walk. ‘I’m not really made to walk so everyday I choose to do that and it comes with a pay off. 
‘I’m literally walking on the tips of bones so through out the day that eventually wears me out and brings pain on.’ Hot Music!!!
