An Oklahoma man was arrested after he led police on a chase that lasted several hours, as he drove a stolen truck through fields, through red lights, and through fences. Brenton Hager made his crime extra douchey when he pulled out his cell phone and live-streamed the event. He was finally arrested when his truck got stuck in a swamp and was tased.
