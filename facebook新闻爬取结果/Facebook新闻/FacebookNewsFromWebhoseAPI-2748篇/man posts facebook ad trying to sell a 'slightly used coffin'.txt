Facebook users can sell a lot of different things in the site's online marketplace, but one item up for sale left many people talking. 
Earlier this week, a man in New Mexico posted an ad trying to sell a coffin - that had a little wear and tear to it. 
"Slightly used coffin, only once used," the ad read. "Serious buyers only. This is a great deal. No holds." 
The guy said the second-hand casket was going for $50.

Although the ad now says the coffin has been sold, KRQE reports that it was all a joke. The guy who tried to make a few bucks off it said he posted the ad to see what kind of comments it would get. 
Some Facebook users found it humorous and tried to talk the seller into lowering the price, while others commented that the ad crossed a line. Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails
