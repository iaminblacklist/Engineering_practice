Mugabe’s two sons took to Facebook to express support for their father, Zimbabwe’s longtime president, who has been put under house arrest as the country’s military reportedly continues negotiations to find a new leader. 
Chatunga Bellarmine Mugabe, with his brother Robert Junior, posted a video on Facebook featuring an interview of Mugabe from 1980. 
In the clip Mugabe , who had just been elected prime minister of Zimbabwe, tells BBC how he denounces military takeovers. “I’m prime minister of my country, and I intend to rule that country with firmness. I’m not going to have anybody advocate the overthrowing of a government and remain in the country. He’s not one of us if he does that. The alternative is to put him in detention and I don’t want to do that,” Mugabe said. © REUTERS/ Philimon Bulawayo/Files Top 5 Things You Should Know About Zimbabwe's Longtime Leader Mugabe Robert Mugabe Jr., also posted the same clip to his Instagram account, accompanied by the caption: “Peace and love over everything.”
Both the brothers reportedly live a lavish lifestyle in South Africa. Chatunga Mugabe, 21, is known for his party lifestyle, which he often shares with thousands of his followers on social media. 
Last week he shared a photo apparently pouring a 200 euro bottle of champagne over his watch, which he claimed was worth 45,000 euros.

President Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is the world’s oldest head of state and one of the longest ruling authoritarian leaders. On Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s army with tanks entered the outskirts of Harare raising speculations about a military coup. The leader of Zimbabwe’s War Veterans Association told ITV News that the military had removed Mugabe. 
The army, however, said in a televised statement on Wednesday that there was no "military takeover of government" underway and that the president was "safe and sound." ...
