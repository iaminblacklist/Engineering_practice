One day recently my city prompted me to log into Facebook again which was unusual but I did it. By the way, I hate that it doesnt show you any details about whose Facebook account you're logging into. Some games show you the name of the person Anyway I realized a few days later that it logged into my sisterâ€™s Facebook account! She uses my ipad sometimes. How is that even freaking possible?!! How do I get it back on my facebook? Has to be a way since my city was able to change allegiance once already.
