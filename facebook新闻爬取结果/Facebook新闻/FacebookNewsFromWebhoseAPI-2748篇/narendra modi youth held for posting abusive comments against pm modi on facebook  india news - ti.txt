MADURAI: An unemployed youth, allegedly a fan of actor Vijay , who posted derogatory comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has been arrested by Srivilliputhur town police. The incident is believed to be the fallout of the recent standoff between state BJP leaders and fans of the actor over the latter's recent release 'Mersal'. 

Some of the film's dialogues and critical references to GST had whipped up a controversy. 

It was against this backdrop that BJP district secretary K Marimuthu had filed a complaint with Srivilliputhur town police stating that someone by the name "Sachin Thiru" had posted derogatory comments against Modi on his Facebook page. The user had even stated that the PM would be taught a lesson. 

Srivilliputhur police found that the comments could have been posted between October 23 and 29 and narrowed down their search to Ramakrishnapuram where they nabbed S Thirumurugan.
