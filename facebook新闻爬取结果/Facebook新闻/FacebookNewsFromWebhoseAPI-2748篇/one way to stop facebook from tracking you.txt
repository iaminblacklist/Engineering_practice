One way to stop Facebook from tracking you By Komando Staff, Komando.com Â© Rawpixelimages | Dreamstime.com 
Q. How can I block Facebook from posting everything I look at on a website? For example, if I go on Amazon and look to buy something, that same item is posted on my Facebook status like it's spying on me. Same thing if I go on eBay. Whatever I look at is posted on my status asking if I am still interested in bidding on it. How do I block this?

Many online companies are members of ad networks, and each ad network puts a bit of code called a "cookie" on your computer. When you visit one of the member sites, the site recognizes the cookie and lets the ad network know where you are so it can send you ads. 
Even worse, the member sites share what you do on their sites to build a database of what you like and don't like or even specific items you looked at. This makes it easier for the ad network to send you ads that it thinks you'll click on. Continued on next page
