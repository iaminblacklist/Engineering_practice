Outrage after Thai monk solicits boys for sex on Facebook November 9, 2017 Monks behaving badly (Library image) Buddhist Facebook users in the North have called on authorities to investigate and find a man believed to be a Buddhist monk who has been exposed in a leaked chat allegedly arranging to buy sex from a teenage boy. 
The chat has been widely shared on Facebook. The chat purportedly records a conversation between the teenager and the man, who is believed to be a monk from a temple in Nan. 
The boy sent a naked photo to the man and offered sexual services for Bt1,000 (S$41.50). The chat was conducted in the northern dialect of Thai. 
The man told the boy to park his car outside a pavilion, but when the boy told him that his friend would bring him to the temple and pick him up later, the man asked whether he could also buy sexual services from the friend. 
When the boy said no, the man replied he would have sex with them both. – ANN
