PETALING JAYA: For Mujahidin Zulkiffli, Facebook has been great help when carrying out his volunteer work.
A plea for funds on the social media platform to help Penang flood victims enabled him to collect about RM4,400 from his friends and followers in a relatively short span of time.
He said every sen would be accounted for and receipts would be posted from time to time on his Facebook page, which has more than 7,000 followers.
Mujahidin said he plans to remain in Penang for a week but may extend his stay if donations continue to come in.
He said the donations are spent on helping the people, while his own expenses, such as for accommodation, is coming out of his own pocket.
Mujahidin, a self-employed businessman from Kuala Lumpur, drove to Kampung Pisang in Ayer Hitam on Monday.
He delivered some foodstuff to villagers there and helped to clean some of their houses.
"I'm just a Malaysian who has the time and the ability to do it. I have experience volunteering and I have a car. As long as people send me money to help out here, I will be here," he told The Star Online on Tuesday.
Besides food, Mujahidin has been trying to source for water jet cleaners, shovels and cleaning materials.
Mujahidin also helped out during the 2014 floods in Kelantan, spending three weeks in the east coast state as he received RM45,000 in donations.
However, he advised those who want to help out in disasters to do their research first before attempting the journey.
"If you are inexperienced and have no idea what to do, the victims could end up worrying about you," he said, adding that there was a lot of work that needed to be done.
