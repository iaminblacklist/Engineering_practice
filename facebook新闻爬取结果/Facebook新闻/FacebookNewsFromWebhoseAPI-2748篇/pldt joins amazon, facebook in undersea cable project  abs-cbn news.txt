MANILA - PLDT Inc said Monday it was investing P7 billion in a consortium composed of tech giants to build an undersea data cable. 
Other investors in the Trans-Pacific system called Jupiter include Amazon, Facebok, Softbank and NTT Communications. PLDT said Jupiter will make its connections to the US and Japan more resilient. 
Jupiter will directly connect Maruyama and Shima in Japan and Los Angeles in the US to Daet, PLDT's cable landing station that faces the Pacific Ocean. 
"We are investing in this new cable system in anticipation of the continued explosion of data traffic over the next few years, as households and businesses in the Philippines adopt more and more digital services," PLDT President Manuel Pangilinan said in a statement. 
Super Typhoon 'Hato' hit Hong Kong in August, disrupting PLDT's services. It took about a month for the company to restore normal connectivity. 
PLDT has 4 other international cable systems. Jupiter is expected to be ready for service by early 2020.
