Rep. Elise M. Stefanik pressed officials from Facebook, Twitter and Google about their policing of fraudulent accounts and advertising, as House and Senate committees review Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
“Election day is a specific date, polls close at a specific time, we live in a breakneck media environment today,” said Ms. Stefanik, R-Willsboro. “Being able to identify and shut down those ads quickly is incredibly important to solving this going into 2018.” 
During the House Intelligence Committee hearing, she also asked representatives for the three companies about how many accounts are bots or trolls not operated by humans. 
Colin Stretch, Facebook general counsel, said about 2 percent of their more than 2 billion accounts are fake. 
Sean Edgett, Twitter general counsel, said less than 5 percent of their 330 million accounts are fake. Kent Walker, Google general counsel, said he did not have specific numbers, but called it a “relatively small number.”
