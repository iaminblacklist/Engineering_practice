An early Facebook and Google investor said Tuesday that revelations of Russian propaganda during the election have elevated his concerns about the personal data collected by the tech giants. 
About 150 million Americans came in contact with divisive content or advertisements from bogus Russian-based accounts, according to Facebook. Russian state actors are also suspected of trying to influence the election through platforms like Google and Twitter .
"Those people have all been Zucked. They've all had their brains altered, and they've come to believe things that weren't true. And I want Facebook to contact every one of them," Roger McNamee said, referencing Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg .
Mark Neuling | CNBC Roger McNamee "I don't know if I would have seen it if it hadn't been for the Russian thing," McNamee told CNBC's " Squawk Alley ." "It was only because weird things were going on in the election that I even noticed something was weird." 
McNamee said Facebook should contact each person who came in contact with any "baloney" Russian propaganda on the social media site. He also said it's important that Congress ask the CEOs to come in and discuss any Russian election interference in public.
"The thing that's so different about Facebook and Google is they have personal data on every adult and most young people," McNamee said. "They are going straight into the brain of 2 billion people, and we don't have evolutionary defenses for that."
McNamee is a managing director at investment firm Elevation Partners, which invested in companies like Yelp, Palm and Facebook. Former Apple executive Fred Anderson and musician Bono also help lead the group.

McNamee's comments came after Sean Parker — an early Facebook executive — said the site
