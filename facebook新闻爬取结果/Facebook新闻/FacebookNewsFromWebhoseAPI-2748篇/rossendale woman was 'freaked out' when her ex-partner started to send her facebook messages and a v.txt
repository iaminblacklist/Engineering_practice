Rossendale woman was 'freaked out' when her ex-partner started to send her facebook messages and a video Andrew Bellard Court reporter Blackburn Magistrates. 
A ROSSENDALE woman was 'freaked out' when her ex-partner started to send her facebook messages and a video. 
Blackburn magistrates heard Michael John Burns appeared drunk in the video and he later told police he couldn't remember making that or sending the messages. 
Burns, 45, of Castlefield Close, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to breaching a restraining order in favour of Eleanor Wade. 
He was sentenced to 10 weeks in prison suspended for 12 months with a 40 day rehabilitation activity requirement and curfew for 10 weeks between 7pm and 5am. He was made subject to a restraining order for two years which prohibits him from having any contact with Miss Wade or entering the borough of Rossendale. He was ordered to pay £115 victim surcharge and £85 costs. 
Catherine Allan, prosecuting, said Miss Wade didn't report the first contact to the police because she thought it would be a one off. Others followed and then came the video in which he said he missed her. 
"She said that freaked her out," said Miss Allan. "It was the first time he had been in touch with her for some time and it made her skin crawl. She has also been made aware that he has started to attend bike trails in Rossendale where she lives." 
Stuart Kaufman, defending, said his client couldn't remember sending the messages. 
"That is believable when you see the video and exactly how drunk he was," said Mr Kaufman. "The messages were not friendly, they were quite friendly, but not desired or welcome."
