CALIFORNIA, U.S. - Faced with intense scrutiny and grilled by lawmakers on Russia’s campaign to manipulate U.S. voters and the use of social media - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that he is open to legislation. 
Zuckerberg stressed that he is “dead serious” about preventing future interference by foreign powers in U.S. elections on his social network. 
He added that the company is working with Congress on political ad-transparency legislation. 
Zuckerberg said on a conference call with investors to discuss earnings, “I think this could be very good, if done well.” 
The statement by the boss of the social media powerhouse came the same day as Facebook’s general counsel represented the company during hours of congressional testimony on Russia’s campaign to manipulate U.S. voters. 
Zuckerberg said, “I’ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust. What they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it. For those who have followed Facebook you know that when we set our minds to something, we’re going to do it.” 
Further, he reiterated that he would double Facebook’s security staff to 20,000 people, adding that he will invest in better artificial intelligence technology. 
Zuckerberg also said he would coordinate with Congress and the intelligence community.
