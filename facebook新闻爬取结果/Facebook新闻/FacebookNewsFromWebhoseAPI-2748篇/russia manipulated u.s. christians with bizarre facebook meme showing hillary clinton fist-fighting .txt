Earlier this week, it was revealed that a Russian-backed website launched a campaign to convince conservatives that African-Americans had turned against the celebration of Christmas. 
Now a new Russian Facebook meme revealed by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) during a Senate Intelligence hearing on Wednesday shows that the Russian government took over-the-top measures to depict former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as anti-Christian by showing her getting into a boxing match with Jesus Christ. 
The meme, which was made by a Russia-created Facebook Christian group called “Army of Jesus,” shows Jesus and Clinton — who is dressed in a red devil costume complete with horns — facing off against one another with their fists raised. The caption under the meme reads, “‘Like’ if you want Jesus to win!” 
As Mashable notes , the Senate hearings also revealed that Russian Facebook groups tried to organize both pro-Muslim and anti-Muslim demonstrations that would occur at the exact same times and places, in an effort to spark conflict between groups that shared mutual hatreds.
