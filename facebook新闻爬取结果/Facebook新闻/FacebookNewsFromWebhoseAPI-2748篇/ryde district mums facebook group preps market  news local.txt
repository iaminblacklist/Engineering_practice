Having a baby at Ryde best in state Three generations born at Ryde Hospital A MOTHERS group known for its online chatter is coming together in person for its first Christmas market.
The founders of the Ryde District Mums community, Jessica Matthews and Jacqui Owens, are organising the event at Eden Gardens, Macquarie Park, for Thursday November 16.
The Twilight Christmas Market will have stalls offering artisan goods such as candles, jewellery, clothing, food and more.

It has since grown to more than 6000 members, who often organise activities such as morning teas and movie nights.
Ms Matthews said they had sold more than 160 tickets to the market.
“People will come with their friends and family and have it as a ladies night out,” she said.
“How often do you get to shop with a glass of champagne and your girlfriends.”
The market will have a social conscience, too. Ms Matthews and Ms Owens are asking people to bring a small gift for the needy.
The market, open only to adults, will trade from 6.30pm to 9.30pm. Entry is $10.
