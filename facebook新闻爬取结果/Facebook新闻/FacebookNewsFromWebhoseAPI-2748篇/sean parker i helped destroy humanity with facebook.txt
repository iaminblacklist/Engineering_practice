The billionaire and former Facebook president Sean Parker now says he regrets helping turn the social network into a global phenomenon. The site grew by "exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology" with its greed for attention and the careful reward system it created to keep users addicted. 
"We need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever... It's a social-validation feedback loop... a vulnerability in human psychology," he admitted to news site Axios . 
Parker's backing was instrumental in turning the Harvard campus-only software into a global phenomenon by introducing Zuckerberg to Silicon Valley venture capital. (Parker was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network .) As a reward, Parker was made company president, but only briefly – he was fired early on after being arrested for cocaine possession, although never charged. Parker retained four per cent of the company's stock. 
His net worth is estimated at $7.8bn. 
Parker was 15 when he met Shawn Fanning via the computer hacking underground, and the pair would later start Napster in 1999. Parker has subsequently become an investor in Spotify . His less inspired ideas include starting a Chatroulette clone and donating to a Political Action Committee created as a vehicle for the eccentric law professor Lawrence Lessig . Politico later described this as "money down the drain". We could have told you that before you opened your wallet. Bootnote
