Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., pushed back on social media companies to better identify fake Russian content in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Nov. 1. 
The hearing, which involved executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter, is investigating the companies' involvement in and awareness of Russian interference with the 2016 election on their platforms. 
Lankford asked during the hearing that the companies make examples of fake Russian content more obvious to users, and do more to monitor misleading Russian advertising, according to a press release from Lankford's team. 
"This is not an opposition to free speech. This is actually a battle to try to protect free speech," Lankford said during the hearing. "We want to have good American dialogue. The fear is that your platforms are being used by foreign actors who want to abuse our free speech." 
The hearing also revealed that some of the companies were aware of the intrusive Russian content to some degree as early as 2015, according to the release. Lankford asked the companies for more transparency moving forward to increase public awareness of fake content on social media platforms. 
"We really do want these ads to get out in the public space," Lankford said in the hearing. "We think there's great value for all of your platforms to say this is the type of content that foreign actors are trying to put out that is actually divisive content."
