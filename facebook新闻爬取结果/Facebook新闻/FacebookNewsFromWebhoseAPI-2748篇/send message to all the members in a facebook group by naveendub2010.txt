Facebook API Send message to all the members in a Facebook group 
I want to send one single message to all the members in a Facebook Group.I am a member of that group.I know about few software but I am thinking it's risky to do that 
Note - I don't want my Facebook ID to be blocked. 
Whoever will do this, have to teach me also about this strategy, then only I will award him this project. Please bid only if you can really do this [url removed, login to view]'s not waste our time. I again insist please read it carefully, think if you can really do and then bid for this project
