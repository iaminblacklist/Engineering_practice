Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Getty Images Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel took to Twitter to clear up some fake rumors about Snapchat shutting down and to tweet a smiley-faced emoji to a man who told Spiegel he had deleted his Facebook account. Spiegel's tweet highlights that the longstanding feud between Snapchat and Facebook continues. 
Evan Spiegel isn't big on Twitter — the Snapchat CEO is famous for meticulously deleting each of his tweets and recently took a two-year break from the site before returning last September to tweet about a transcoding snafu on Snap. But on Monday night, Spiegel was active on Twitter once more — this time to clear up some fake rumors regarding a Snapchat shutdown and to throw some shade at the company's longtime rival: Facebook. 
When Twitter user Jacob Catalono tweeted to Spiegel "I deleted Facebook the other day. It was a fantastic decision." Spiegel tweeted back a minute later, responding with the single most jubilant, approving symbol of the modern age: the super smiley Emoji face. ☺️ 
Spiegel's feud with Facebook is longstanding. In May, Spiegel compared Snapchat's rivalry with Facebook to the early days of Google's dealings with Yahoo . After Snapchat turned down Facebook's $3 billion offer to buy the company in 2013, Facebook set out along the path of largely copying most of Snapchat's most innovative or unique features — for example, releasing a story-sharing app that essentially cloned Snapchat's — further aggravating the tension between the two social media giants and the app designers working within them.
