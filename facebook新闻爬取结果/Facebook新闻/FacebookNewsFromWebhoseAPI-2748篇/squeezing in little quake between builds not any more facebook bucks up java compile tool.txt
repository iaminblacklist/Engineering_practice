in General Citing the social network's need for speed, Facebook senior software engineer Jonathan Keljo says the company's developer tools group has revisited how its Buck open-source build tool compiles Java code and made it faster still.As such a new version of the software was released today for programmers to fetch and play with: it's under the source_only ABI generation mode. Buck - Android - Times - IOS Developed in 2012 and open sourced in 2013, Buck was created to hasten Android build times and has since been adapted to work with iOS."The tools at that time available for Android were slowing us down," said Keljo in a phone interview with The Register. "So Buck was created to try to fix that." Code - Time - Keljo - Draft - Blog Compiling code can take time, sometimes so much so that Keljo in a draft blog post provided to The Register likened slow build cycles to an "exhausting, soul-killing fountain of frustration."This rather colorful characterization of delay was excised from the official announcement, perhaps by communications minders wary that hyperbole might be misconstrued. Hours - Java - Compiler - Keljo - Time Asked if we were talking about idling away hours waiting for the Java compiler, Keljo said the time savings would be measured in seconds."If the builds were in hours, there would be pitchforks and torches," he said, noting that build times interrupt the edit-run-compile cycle. Web - Devs - Tune - Sites - Seconds Given that web devs tune sites to shave seconds from page load times for fear of losing online visitors to boredom, Facebook's fanaticism for fast is perhaps more understandable.And while Facebook's gains may be but seconds due to its longstanding focus on optimization, less sophisticated users of Java could recoup minutes or hours, maybe. Android - Apps - Team - Others - Java To save its Android apps team and others crafting Java programs from waiting while source code to get translated into JAR files, Keljo and colleagues have made several changes recently to the way Buck works.Facebook's Android app became so large that...   www.theregister.co.uk 4
