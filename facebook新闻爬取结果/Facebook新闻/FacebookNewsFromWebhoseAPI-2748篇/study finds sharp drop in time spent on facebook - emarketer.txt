Article by Rahul Chadha Nov 21, 2017 Study Finds Sharp Drop in Time Spent on Facebook Verto Analytics data shows fewer visits than a year ago 
Facebook has sat atop the social media competition pretty much since its inception. Even today the platform appears to benefit from its first-mover advantage, more than 10 years after its founding. 
But new research from Verto Analytics found a sharp decline in usage in its latest study. 
According to the latest monthly data from the firm, Facebook users in the US spent more time with the platform than users of any other social network, 18 hours, 24 minutes. But that was a significant drop from the 32 hours, 43 minutes recorded by Verto Analytics a year ago. Download 
The dropoff seen in the Verto Analytics data is at odds with eMarketer's latest estimates for time spent with Facebook. eMarketer expects adult US Facebook users to spend roughly 41 minutes per day on the platform in 2017, up one minute from 40 minutes in 2016. 
A survey by RBC Capital Markets in May found that Facebook users said they expected to spend less time with the platform in the coming 12 months, but the expected differences were not stark. For instance, among 19-25 year-olds, 63% said they expected to spend the same amount of time as before, while 25% said they would spend less and 12% said more. Download 
Verto Analytics said that Facebook users logged in less frequently than last year. The number of Facebook sessions per user fell from 311 in 2016 to just 173 this year. 
Snapchat, meanwhile, saw gains in both time spent and average sessions per user, although it still trailed Facebook by a wide margin in both categories. 
Snapchat users spent 4 hours with the platform, up almost an hour from 2016. In addition, the number of sessions per user climbed from 119 last year to 144 this year. 
Overall, Facebook and its associated properties still remained entrenched among top US social networks as measured by monthly unique users, according to Verto Analytics data. Facebook recorded 199.4 million monthly unique users in October 2017, followed by Instagram (144.3 million), Twitter (110.8 million), Facebook Messenger (104.7 million) and Pinterest (84.4 million).
