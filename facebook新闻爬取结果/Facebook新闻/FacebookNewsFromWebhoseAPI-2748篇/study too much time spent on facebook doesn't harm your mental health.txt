A new study shows people who spend more time on social media aren't more likely to suffer from mental health issues. Researchers at the University of Central Florida have studied the potential harm of social media, particularly in relation to young people's health. Their findings have just been published in the journal, Psychiatric Quarterly . They found it's the way people use sites like Facebook and Instagram, rather than the time they spend on them, that influences their health, reports The Wireless . "Why the popular press, suicide advocates and policy-makers continue to home in on time spent online as a cause of mental health problems is an interesting question, particularly given lack of clear evidence," the report said.

The researchers referred to "vaguebooking" as the most prominent negative way young people use social media. Vaguebooking is writing unclear but alarming posts to get attention. Vaguebooking often prompts friends to ask what's going on. Vaguebooking was found to be more common among people who reported lonely feelings and who were more likely to have suicidal thoughts. More than 450 young adults in the US were surveyed for the study. The average age was close to 20. They were asked about social media and their personal lives and were quizzed on the role social media plays in their lives. They discussed their anxiety levels and personal relationships. The researchers said they were inspired by the amount of public concern about the overuse of social media. They said some past studies have tried to link social media with suicidality, loneliness and decreased empathy. Related articles:
