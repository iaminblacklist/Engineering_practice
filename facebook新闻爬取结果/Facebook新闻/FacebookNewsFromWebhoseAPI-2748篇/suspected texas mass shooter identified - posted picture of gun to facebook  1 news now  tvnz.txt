In the post, he boasted that "she's a bad b***h," referring to the gun. 
AR-15 rifles were also used in the Las Vegas attack just over a month ago, but the rifle pictured in Kelley's post did not appear to be equipped with a 'bump-stock' device, enabling it to simulate automatic fire. 
The New York Times reported Kelley is from Comal County, Texas, but was a resident of San Antonio. 
He reportedly served in the US Air Force after graduating high school, but CBS reported he was dishonorably discharged in May of 2014 following a court martial. The lone shooter walked into the Baptist church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire. Source: BBC 
CNN reported witnesses describing the shooter as wearing "full gear" when he walked into the church and started shooting. 
He then fled the scene in a white vehicle, and was chased by a local resident before crashing and fleeing on foot. 
Whether he was shot by his pursuer or took his own life has not been confirmed. 
The victims were aged from five to 72. Over 20 people are feared dead after the incident at a Baptist church is Sutherland Springs. Source: Associated Press
