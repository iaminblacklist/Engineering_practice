Teen killer boasted on Facebook about plans to murder schoolteacher Published time: 14 Nov, 2017 09:03 Get short URL Will Cornick © Wikipedia A schoolboy who murdered his teacher boasted that he would kill her “for £10” on Facebook, an inquest into her death has heard. Will Cornick, now 19, is serving a minimum 20-year sentence for stabbing Ann Maguire during a Spanish lesson. 
Most of Cornick’s classmates at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds did not believe he was serious when he announced plans to kill Maguire in 2014, the inquest was told. One pupil backed down from reporting it when Cornick threatened to kill them as well. Even those who saw the kitchen knife stashed up his sleeve did not think he would actually use it. 
Wakefield Coroner’s Court heard that “petite” Maguire, 61, “had no chance” of survival against the “strapping” 6ft 2ins student, then aged 15, who had posted plans to kill her as long as four months before, according to the Daily Mail. 
“I would kill Maguire for a tenner [£10 ($13)] … if I do it [kill her] on Tuesday will you bail me out? Let’s break into school, smash everything in Spanish, then get drunk, do it again and punch some walls,” he wrote on Facebook. He then changed his profile picture to the Grim Reaper.

A number of private Facebook messages exchanged with others were read to the jury. In one message, he said: “As long as she’s alive. I’ll be depressed, sad and angry … so there’s only one thing to do.” In another, he said about Maguire: “The one absolute f g b***h that deserves more than death, more pain than torture, and more than anything we can understand.” 
On Christmas Eve, Cornick said: “If imbgonna [sic] be your assassin then i’m gonna need enough pay to bail me out if I get caught. Btw no b*
