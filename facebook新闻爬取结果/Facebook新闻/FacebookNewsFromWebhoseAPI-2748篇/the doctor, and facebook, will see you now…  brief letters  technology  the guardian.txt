Your article ( Trump’s resort ‘has ruined protected Scottish dunes’ , 9 November) could well have also drawn attention to the current application by two US multimillionaires to similarly develop the Coul links on the Sutherland coast, north of Dornoch.

Full details and video can be found on the protester’s website at notcoul.com . Wendy Ritson Taunton, Somerset 
• I always have my location data switched off ( Privacy is not enough , 10 November). I was in the doctor’s surgery once and logged on to Facebook. Immediately the practice manager’s profile came up, “we think you may know this person etc”. Coincidence? Anne Williams Hove, East Sussex 
• On Wednesday, my wife and I travelled from Portsmouth to London Waterloo. As a result of strike action ( Report , 8 November), the following unfolded: the train departed on time, it was twice as long as usual, there was an SWT employee walking the train, there were plenty of seats, a trolley service and we arrived on time. Same on the return journey. Can SWT bring its strike planning to bear every day please? Mike Nash University of Portsmouth 
• Every year I spend six weeks studiously avoiding the John Lewis Christmas ad. You’re not helping ( Never knowingly underspent , 10 November). Dorothy Rank Glossop, Derbyshire 
• In studying the ability of sheep to recognise celebrities (Report, 8 November), did the researchers control for their participants’ prior exposure to ewetube? Peter Barnes Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire 
• Similarly, if any rapper wants to change their moniker ( Letters , 8 November) to Duck (P Duck, Bro Duck etc) they will find a warm welcome in Nottingham. Rick Hall
