Facebook is going much bigger with a planned data center in New Mexico. 
Gov. Susana Martinez and company officials are expected to announce expansion plans Tuesday morning for a data center in Los Lunas, a rural area just outside of Albuquerque. 
The Albuquerque Journal reports that the social media giant is now going to construct six buildings instead of just two, bringing its investment to $1 billion. 
Martinez has previously touted Facebook as an important partner as the state works to diversify its economy. 
New Mexico has been looking to turn the corner after a crippling budget crisis that stemmed from a downturn in the oil and natural gas sectors and an overall weak economy. 
The state also has struggled with high unemployment numbers.
