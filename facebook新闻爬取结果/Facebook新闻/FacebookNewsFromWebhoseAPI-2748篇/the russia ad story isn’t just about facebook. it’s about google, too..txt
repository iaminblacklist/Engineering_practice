In the northeast region of Kazakhstan, near the Russian border, sits a stretch of land where the Soviet Union spent years testing the atomic bomb. During the Cold War, the government conducted more than 400 nuclear tests at a compound known as the \"Polygon\" in Semipalatinsk, a city 200,000 people called home. In this three-part documentary, VICE‚Äôs Abdullah Saeed, Danielle Neftin, and Dina Rayzman take a road trip through Russia and into Kazakhstan to visit the Polygon and meet the people who still live in Semipalatinsk, despite its nuclear contamination and health risks. Along the way, the trio drinks vodka with Russian separatists and samples antler blood, before zipping on their protective suits and heading directly into one of the most radioactive spots on Earth.

Putin's farmer - agriculture and business in Russia | DW Documentary published: 21 Oct 2017 Putin's farmer - agriculture and business in Russia | DW Documentary Putin's farmer - agriculture and business in Russia | DW Documentary published: 21 Oct 2017 views: 19 
One of Putin‚Äôs biggest fans and a prominent businessman in the agriculture industy, Stefan D√ºrr has built a farming empire in Russia. D√ºrr emigrated from Germany to Siberia when he was a student and now has his own empire in Russia. He owns at least 200,000 hectares of land and has 60,000 cows and 4,000 employees. Two years ago Vladimir Putin personally handed him the certificate of Russian citizenship. Russia wants to become independent of European Union imports and D√ºrr‚Äôs milk empire benefits from this policy. That‚Äôs because he also receives some of the state subsidies that are being invested in building up Russia‚Äôs agriculture. Wherever D√ºrr shows up, be it at the Agrofarm agricultural trade show in Moscow, or at the regional ministries of Kaluga and Voronezh, people listen to him and rely on him. We meet a man who waxes lyrical about how much he has been able to grow in Russia, how he has been able to buy land and develop as an entrepreneur and also get involved in politics. D√ºrr is an ice hockey fan: \'Germany,\' he says, \'is like football: very thought through, following strict rules. Fouls are punished, dives could be worth it. In Russia it‚Äôs like ice hockey: faster, more spontaneous, tougher - and yet still following fair rules.\' It‚Äôs a game that D√ºrr seems to have a talent for. __
