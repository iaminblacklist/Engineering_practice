How good is your mental arithmetic? This tricky test separates the geniuses from the maths flops By Sophie Roberts 24th November 2017, 12:14 pm Updated: 25th November 2017, 4:02 am A FIENDISHLY tricky problem will put your maths skills to the test. 
The puzzle, which emerged on Facebook this week, has left the British public scratching their heads. Facebook Can you solve this puzzle or will it leave you feeling baffled? 
To solve the problem, you must find the value of a clock, some bananas and a shape. 
Social media users have also been warned that the "answer isn't 19 or 26". 
So can you solve it? 
More than 11,000 people have taken to Facebook to share their answers - which range from 25 to 165. 
It's actually an alegebra problem--the three lines are a set of simultaneous equations which you may remember from GCSE maths. 
Taken together, the top three equations give you values for the three unknowns--and show the answer is 67. How to find the answer It's just an algebra problem dressed up with symbols in place of letters. 
If you say that Shape = a, Bananas = b and Clock = c, the top equations read: 
3a = 15 
b + 2c = 10 

The first equation shows a is worth 15. The second clue shows that b is worth 4 (23-15/2). This means the c is worth 3 ([10-4]/2). 

Using the same rules, the bottom line then reads: 

c + a + (a x b) 

Putting in the answer from above we get the following sum:
