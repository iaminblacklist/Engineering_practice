chat comments Thousands of BLM Activists Attend a Protest Organized by Russians on Facebook Although the mainstream media seem to be focusing solely on how Russia supposedly helped Donald Trump win the presidential election, the truth of the matter is that the Kremlin also pushed Facebook to push leftist issues. Case in point: Thousands of Americans attended a march last November organized by a Russian group that used social media to interfere in the 2016 election. The demonstration in New York City, which took place a few days after the election, appears to be the largest and most successful known effort to date pulled off by Russian-linked groups intent on using social media platforms to influence American politics. Sixteen thousand Facebook users said that they planned to attend a Trump protest on Nov. 12, 2016, organized by the Facebook page for BlackMattersUS, a Russian-linked group that sought to capitalize on racial tensions between black and white Americans. The event was shared with 61,000 users. Eventually, 5,000 to 10,000 protesters did actually convene at Manhattan's Union Square. From there, they marched to Trump Tower. The group wrote on its Facebook event page for the rally: Join us in the streets! Stop Trump and his bigoted agenda! Divided is the reason we just fell. We must unite despite our differences to stop HATE from ruling the land. Although many people seem to obsess over Russia's interference in U.S. politics before the election, the protest proves that this meddling continued until well after Election Day and that Russia wasn't pro-Trump as much as it was (and continues to be) pro- chaos .
