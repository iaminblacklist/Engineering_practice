The organisers of a popular Facebook page that gives residents in Larkhall a forum where they can reminisce about the town’s history have released their third charity calendar (pictured). 
The Two Larky Mashers from High Avon Street have produced their 2018 calendar and it is now on sale. 
Last year the sale of the calendar raised thousands of pounds for four local charities and this year the organisers say, thanks to the generosity of sponsors, they hope to raise even more cash this year. 
Tommy McPhee, of The Two Larky Mashers from High Avon Street Facebook page, said: “We have printed 600 calendars with the help of our 16 sponsors this year which is great. 
“When all the calendars are sold there will be no more printed so they really are a real collectors’ item. 
“We have already sold calendars all over the world and are keen to build on last year’s success.” 
The calendars are available from Burns The Stationers, the Co-op on Union Street and the Repair Centre on Montgomery Street. Like us on Facebook
