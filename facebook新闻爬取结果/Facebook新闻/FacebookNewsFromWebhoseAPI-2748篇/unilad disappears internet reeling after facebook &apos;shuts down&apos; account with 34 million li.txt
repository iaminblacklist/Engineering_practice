The Facebook page of viral news website UniLad was reportedly blocked by the social network for several hours on Friday. 
The hugely popular page, which has over 34 million likes, disappeared from the site in the early hours of Friday morning. It was reinstated at about 3pm. 
Attempts to view the page were greeted with the error message: "The link you followed may be broken, or the page may have been removed." 
Unilad confirmed their page had been deleted by Facebook to the Telegraph. Anyone trying to visit the page is greeted with this message (Facebook) 
Social media users were left reeling at the temporary disappearance of one of the biggest viral pages in the world: 
Some claimed the shutdown was due to a spate of insensitive comments on a post about the death of 21-year-old rapper Lil Peep, which were apparently not moderated by the media company. 
Others claimed the site had been using videos without permission: 
After it was deleted, new pages began to pop up on Facebook claiming to be the new Unilad. 
It is unclear whether these are official or parody accounts. 
The online magazine claimed its Facebook page was the biggest in the world in 2016. Its videos can amass millions of views. 
Like its close competitor LADBible, it depends on the social media giant as one of the biggest drivers of traffic to its website. 
It remains unknown whether Unilad violated Facebook's community guidelines.
