Facebook's change ushered in a sea change. Twitter (TWTR) flipped the switch on autoplay back in 2015 (https://blog.twitter.com/marketing/en_us/a/2015/introducing-autoplay-video-and-a-new-standard-for-viewability.html), and now autoplay videos are inescapable on most social media. Indeed, features like Instagram stories are centered on content automatically playing.
But that hasn't made autoplay videos any less annoying for users. If anything, video content has gotten more obtrusive since Facebook began having the audio on videos also begin autoplaying earlier this year. Now, loading Facebook in a quiet spot can be quite the harrowing experience if a user doesn't make sure the sound on their device is turned down ahead of time.
Displeasure with autoplay content is fairly ubiquitous. Since the beginning of the year, autoplay video has been mentioned more than 25,000 times on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit, according to data from Brandwatch, a social intelligence platform. And 74% of those comments made by social media users were negative.
So why hasn't autoplay gone away if so many people hate it? In short, advertisers and brands love it, according to media and marketing publication Digiday (https://digiday.com/media/autoplay-video-beat-regular-video-sorry-guys/%20.).
Whether or not Facebook does anything about this gripe, users are starting to see relief. In June, Apple added an auto-play-blocking function to the new Safari browser for desktops, and Google Chrome will follow next year (https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/auto-play-block/%20https:/arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/google-chrome-block-auto-play-video/). And Facebook users have the ability to stop videos from autoplaying by adjusting their settings.
