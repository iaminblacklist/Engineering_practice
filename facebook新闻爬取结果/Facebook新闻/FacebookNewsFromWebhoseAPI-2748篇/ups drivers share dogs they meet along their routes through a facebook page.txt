Home Animals UPS Drivers Share Dogs They Meet Along Their Routes Through A Facebook Page 
It’s a known fact that most dogs like chasing down their local postal worker. Movies and TV shows portray this interaction as sometimes frightening but that’s not the case for these UPS workers. 
West Virginia UPS driver, Sean McCarren, had the idea to share photos of him and his furry friends with other UPS drivers so he began UPS Dogs. 
Sean shared with TODAY that it’s common for delivery drivers to have dog treats on hand, “I know people who buy a couple of boxes a week,” McCarren told TODAY, “As soon as you deliver to a stop, especially in rural areas, (the dogs) start popping up in your truck.” 
After noticing how many photos of his dog friends he had, Sean began the group in 2013. The group of dog-loving UPS drivers has been going for almost 5 years showcasing photos of our local postal workers with the adorable creatures we adore so much! The page has over 650k followers. 
A spokesperson for UPS told Buzzfeed, “It’s a good example of the relationships our employees build with their customers, two- or four-legged,” And we agree!
