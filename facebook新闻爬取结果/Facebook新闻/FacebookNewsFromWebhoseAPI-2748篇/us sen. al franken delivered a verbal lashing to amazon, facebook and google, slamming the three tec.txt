They are de facto monopolies for web services. Sure there are alternatives to Facebook, Amazon, and Reddit, but their strength and advantage is their size and (in the case of websites like Facebook and Reddit) the fact that everyone pretty much exclusively uses only those websites. It puts all of the information into the hands of one entity. It also makes it so that almost everyone is getting all of their information from one source, and that source can be manipulated in ways that are not open to the public. 
The fact that alternatives exist doesn't mean they are being used, and it's not necessarily because they offer an inferior service, it's also because everyone is already using the big name websites. Google Plus had all of the same features as Facebook when it launched a few years ago, but it fell flat because everyone was already using Facebook.
