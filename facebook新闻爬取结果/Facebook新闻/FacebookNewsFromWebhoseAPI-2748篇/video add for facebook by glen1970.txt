Adobe Premiere Pro Video Add for Facebook 
i need a small 6 second add, mostly graphics made for Facebook. My idea is to have 3 images popping up one after the other and then dropping to the bottom left, bottom centre and bottom right of the frame respectively. 
Frame 1 Text: 
$500 off any Premium Beds in store. 
Frame 2: Plus Sign (+) 
Frame 3: Free Pillows (include picture of Pillow) 
Frame 4: + sign beside Free Pillows 
Frame 5: Free Mattress Protector (include picture of Mattress Protector) 
Frame 6: + sign beside Free mattress protector 
Frame 7: Free Delivery (with image of delivery vehicle) 
Frame 8: Wispa Sleep Logo and address: 1 Ihakara Street, Paraparaumu Phone: 04 298 5498 
Background is White with Purple and black writing. 
the idea is to tell People that we have $500 off our Premium ranges of beds, along with Free Pillows, a Free Mattress Protector and Free Delivery. (see attached Transition screens)
