Tech executives from Google, Twitter and Facebook are speaking with the Senate Judiciary Committee today, on how misinformation and fake news was able to spread throughout social media during the 2016 election.
Representatives from the three companies are expected to appear for two days of hearings and answer questions about Russian interference and online efforts to sway the election in President Trump’s favor. To this end, the three companies are expected to share their internal findings on Russian disinformation campaigns, political ads bought by foreign parties, and troll farms known to generate extreme sociopolitical content.
Today’s hearing comes amid the news that Twitter will no longer allow certain Russian media outlets to purchase advertising on their site. More recently, reports have come out about how Facebook’s estimate that 126m Americans have seen fake campaign ads produced by Russian troll farms.
