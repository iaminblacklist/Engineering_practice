Instagram has also emerged as an important revenue stream. Apart from mobile and video, the monetization opportunities of the company’s other subsidiaries – Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus – and a huge user base/higher engagement levels are expected to drive growth going ahead. Facebook is also dabbling in AR/VR and AI technologies, which bodes well for long term growth. In the last one year, it has vastly outperformed the broader market. However, rising costs and stiffening competition for ad dollars is concerning. Also, the recent uproar surrounding the apparent usage of the platform by Russian elements for interfering in the election process has put Facebook in a spot. Amid all this and tremendous investor pressure, Facebook has scrapped plans to create Class C shares that would have helped Zuckerberg to retain his control over the company.” 9/25/2017 – Facebook was upgraded by analysts at Vetr from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating.
