A Tinder user has taken to Facebook to speak out against discrimination he had received on the dating app - because of his disability. 
Jack Hunter-Spivey was born with cerebral palsy and has lived his whole life in a wheelchair. He says that he has found that his disability has hindered his ability to meet women on the app, because many of them either take pity on him or stop speaking to him altogether when they discover that he is in a wheelchair.

He wrote: "Honest opinion guys... would you date someone in a wheelchair? And what are your first thoughts of a disabled person when you see them? 
"Don't worry I won't get offended by the answer just genuinely interested in people's thoughts. For anyone wondering my willy is indeed in full working order." 
He could never have expected the response that it would receive. 
"I was stunned with the amount of people saying how good looking I was," said Jack, who is a Paralympic table tennis player.

"I've had a lot of girls inboxing me since saying, 'it doesn't matter about your wheelchair, you're really hot'. I've had people on Tinder who won't talk to me after they find out I'm in a wheelchair." 
Jack continued: "I have had past relationships. It is sometimes a struggle to go out and meet people when they see that you are in a wheelchair. 
"I'm just like every other person my age and don't have much trouble initially talking to girls but it is their preconceptions of people in a wheelchair that is sometimes annoying. 
"That they have to feel sorry for me in some way and it comes across sometimes like they are doing a good deed. 
Within a day of posting on Facebook, Jack received more than 20 inbox messages from girls who found him attractive and wanted to go on dates with him. Credit: Mercury Press 
"The Facebook post was great because all the girls weren't bothered that I am in a chair they were just all commenting on my looks. I was really overwhelmed. I just wanted to know what people thought but the response has been incredible. It made me feel really good," he explained. 
"I'm quite a confident person anyway I was just genuinely curious about people's perceptions. I wasn't begging for attention I was just happy to have some. 
"My friend who is also in a wheelchair was really made up with the comments."
