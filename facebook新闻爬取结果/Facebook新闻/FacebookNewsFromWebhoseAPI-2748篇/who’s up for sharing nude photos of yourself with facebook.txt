in General No, this isn’t an Onion article. Facebook has a new pilot program aimed at protecting users from having their nude bodies plastered all over Facebook . . . by requiring that you upload a photo of your nude body to Facebook.They will then “hash” your nakedness (turn it into a unique code); once this is done, your hashed image (now code, not a pic of you in all your glory) will then be flagged and refused upload permissions on Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. Facebook - Safety - Pilot - Australia Facebook’s “intimate safety” pilot is currently only available in Australia.Facebook writes: Facebook - Place - People - Intimate - Images We don’t want Facebook to be a place where people fear their intimate images will be shared without their consent. We’re constantly working to prevent this kind of abuse and keep this content out of our community. We recently announced a test that’s a little different from things we’ve tried in the past. Even though this is a small pilot, we want to be clear about how it works.Australians can complete an online form on the eSafety Commissioner’s official website. Image - Concern - People - Image - Messenger To establish which image is of concern, people will be asked to send the image to themselves on Messenger.The eSafety Commissioner’s office notifies us of the submission (via their form). However, they do not have access to the actual image. Notification - Representative - Community - Operations - Team Once we receive this notification, a specially trained representative from our Community Operations team reviews and hashes the image, which creates a human-unreadable, numerical fingerprint of it.We store the photo hash—not the photo—to prevent someone from uploading the photo in the future. If someone tries to upload the image to our platform, like all photos on Facebook, it is run through a database of these hashes and if it matches we do not allow it to be posted or shared.
