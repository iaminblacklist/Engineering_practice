We are just hours away from the last big hurrah (or not) from tech sector earnings. 
Apple results, due after the close on Thursday, will complete the FAANG-gang reporting cycle. Facebook reported last night, and we’ve already heard from Amazon AMZN, -0.86% , Netflix NFLX, +0.67% and Google owner Alphabet GOOGL, +0.04% . 
There’s angst in the air over those Facebook results — specifically, over its stepped-up spending on security issues , as it battles outside influences. (Russia, anyone?) That brings us to our call of the day from GBH Insights, which tells the Facebook faithful to hang in there, in a classic case of ”near-term pain for long-term gain.” 
“Ultimately, with 2018 margins/profits now forecasted to be under pressure, we would expect some investors to throw in the white towel as ‘a year of investment’ is not what the Street wanted to hear about 2018,” says Daniel Ives, GBH’s head of technology research. 
Security is core to Facebook’s platform success, Ives notes. So those concerns could hang like a dark cloud over its shares until investors see signs the investment is paying off. But investing in newer growth initiatives is vital, he says — think augmented reality and Instagram. 
There’s good news for worried investors, said Ives, who says in his note that Facebook looks to be in good shape when it comes to engagement, monthly active user and ad growth. He’s keeping his “highly attractive” rating and $210 valuation target on Facebook. 
Away from tech, there’s plenty of buzz building over the unveiling (finally) of the Republicans’ tax bill and Trump’s pick for Fed chair, both on deck for later. On with the show.
