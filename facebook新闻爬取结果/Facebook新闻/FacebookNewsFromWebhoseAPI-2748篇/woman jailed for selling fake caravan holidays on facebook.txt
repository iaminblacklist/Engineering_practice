Credit: PA A caravan conwoman has been jailed for selling fake holidays on Facebook.
Rebecca Newcombe, 21, duped more than 25 customers by offering bogus breaks on the Welsh coast.
Newcombe from Ebbw Vale in Gwent, charged between £25 to £580 for holidays and arranged to hand over keys for caravans - but would then fail to show up.
A court heard people booked from as far as 300 miles away in Middlesborough for the holiday breaks.
But Newcombe told customers she had to cancel their trips because members of her family were dying, her children were sick or that she'd been involved in car accidents.
Prosecutor Nick Gedge said that one customer told Newcombe she couldn't afford the £100 deposit for the fake holiday.
Mr Gedge said: "Newcombe told her: 'Just transfer all you've got in the bank'," and the woman handed over £74.64.
Newcombe used several aliases to sell the holidays but police eventually linked her to an account under the name of Kelly Louise Watkins and arrested.
Mr Gedge said: "In her interview she denied having any knowledge of the caravan based fraud."
Newport Crown Court heard despite being arrested Newcombe continued to dupe several more customers.
But six months later Newcombe was questioned again and admitted making more than £4,500 and pleaded guilty to 25 counts of fraud.
Jeff Jones, defending said: "It was a merry dance."
Newcombe, of Beaufort, Ebbw Vale, was jailed for nine months.
Judge Jonathan Furness QC said: "The offences were mean. They were persistent and you persisted with them while you were on bail.
"Your excuses for holidays going wrong or not being able to happen involved sick children, sick members of your family and road traffic accidents."
