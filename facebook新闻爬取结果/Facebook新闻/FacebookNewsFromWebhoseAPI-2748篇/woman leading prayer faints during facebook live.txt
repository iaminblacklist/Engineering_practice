An Atlanta woman might have died if she didn’t have an audience watching her when she fainted — while leading a prayer on Facebook Live.
Francine Sims-Gates (Credit: Channel 2 Action News) Channel 2 Action News Francine Sims-Gates and her family now credit the social media website for saving her life, Channel 2 Action News reported.
She was almost finished leading her daily prayer service when she suddenly felt ill.
“I don’t mean any harm, but right now I do need you to pray for me,” she told her audience.

Then she passed out in her southwest Atlanta apartment bedroom, she told the news station.
Her son, who is legally blind and has autism, couldn’t help Sims-Gates.
But someone called the woman’s daughter, East Point Municipal Court Judge Rashida Oliver.
“Surely when this occurred the first thing I thought was thank God she was on Facebook,” Oliver told Channel 2.
Oliver asked a neighbor to call the leasing office because the apartment was part of a senior living facility, and an agent checked on Sims-Gates and called 911.
Doctors said Sims-Gates’ blood pressure was extremely high and she had blood clots that could have killed her, Channel 2 reported.
The video also helped doctors decide on a treatment plan for Sims-Gates.
