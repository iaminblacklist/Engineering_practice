Woman on Facebook claims nail was found in Halloween candy Posted: CORPUS CHRISTI - 
Several posts on Facebook about nails or razors found inside Halloween candy are going viral. 
One of the post in particular has generated more than 20K shares on Facebook. We contacted the woman behind the post, who explained, her 14-year-old child found a nail inside their candy bar before attempting to eat it. She told us, she is not sure if the wrapper was tampered with because the candy bar was already unwrapped when she saw it. 
She wrote on Facebook, "I'm so upset," then followed with video of the alleged candy with the nail inside. She also encouraged parents to check their candy. 
We reached out to the Corpus Christi Police Department to see if any reports had been filed. Officers told us, they had not received any reports. However, they encourage parents to check their Halloween candy prior to eating it. 
Officers stated, they weren't aware of this incident but they always encourage parents to practice Halloween safety first. 
"This day in age there are people who want to cause harm to good people, this is suppose to be a joyous occasion, we don't want to bring bad memories to sweet children," said Officer Gena Pena. 
The authenticity of the post is unknown. The Facebook user did mention, she was planning to make a police report, Wednesday. She explained, the reason why she hadn't filed earlier was because she didn't know where the candy came from.
