Facebook Messenger has gotten a bunch of upgrades over the past year , and now you can add the ability to send higher-resolution photos to the list. Starting today, Facebook is rolling out the ability to send “4K” photos on the Messenger app in the US, Canada, France, Australia, the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. The company says it will also be introduced to additional countries in the coming weeks.
Previously, Facebook says Messenger only supported "2K" photo uploads. But with the update, the app will now support a maximum resolution of up to 4096 x 4096 pixels. It gives a few examples to point out the difference in clarity and sharpness. On the left is how Messenger would previously send a photo, and on the right is with the higher resolution. When zoomed in , the photos’ edges are definitely crisper, and gradients appear smoother. You’ll have to make sure you’re updated to the latest version of the Messenger app in order to send and share photos in the newly supported resolution.
