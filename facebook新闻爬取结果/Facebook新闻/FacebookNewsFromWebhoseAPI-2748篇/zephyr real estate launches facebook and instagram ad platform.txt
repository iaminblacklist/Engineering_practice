News for 2017-11-13 Zephyr Real Estate Launches Facebook and Instagram Ad Platform 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 13, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In its latest advance in marketing and technology superiority, Zephyr Real Estate just unveiled a new advertising platform that automatically creates Facebook and Instagram ads for all new listings.

The property ad is automatically generated with data pulled from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and delivered to the listing agent’s inbox for review and approval. Ads can be quickly approved to begin an immediate two-week campaign on Facebook and Instagram. Edits, if needed, are easily accomplished through a simple WYSIWYG interface. 
New listings are gleaned from MLS so all the information is consistent, including photography, pricing, size, amenities and other property details. The ads are then geographically and financially targeted to an optimized audience, also automatically. The platform can also be used to promote open house and evening events, as scheduled in the MLS. 
Analytics for the ads are tracked including views, comments, shares and engagements. Results are regularly sent to the listing agent, and can also be shared to the seller. In addition to keeping the seller aware of potential buyer interest in the property, this feature also allows the seller to share the ad and promote their property with their personal social media networks. 
“We found that Facebook’s Ad Manager platform, while robust, could also be a daunting and cumbersome process,” commented Melody Foster, Zephyr’s Vice President of Marketing. “Investing in a simple platform that launches online ads within mere hours of entering the property into the MLS and requires zero effort from our agents is tremendously beneficial to both agents and clients in our fast-paced market.”
