If you watched President Zuma’s QandA in Parliament on Thursday, then you will already be well aware of the “meandos” situation. South Africans on social media were left baffled and filled with laughs as Zuma went on about “meandos”. No one, knew what it meant, except that it sounded a lot like Nando’s. 
In case you missed it, check out the clip of Zuma saying the phrase below. Dear Tweeps. Kindly define “meandos” for me 🤔 #ZumaQandA pic.twitter.com/cFNZgrRy3p

Ok, so now you get the picture. As it turns out, Nando’s certainly got the picture too. Less than 24-hours after Zuma’s QandA the chicken giants had their say on the matter. With Nando’s being known for their brilliant ability to fire shots in their ads, South African were expecting a lot… There’s a Nandos advert somewhere in there.
